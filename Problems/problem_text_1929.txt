Implement pow(x, n) % d.
In other words, given x, n and d,
find (xn % d)
Note that remainders on division cannot be negative. In other words, make sure the answer you return is non negative.


Constraints: 

-109 <= x <= 109
0 <= n <= 109
1 <= d <= 109

Example Input: 

x = 2
n = 3
d = 3


Example Output: 

2

Example Explanation: 

23 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2.
