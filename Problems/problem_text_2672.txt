Implement a heap data structure in C++.

Example: 


Output:

Size is 3
15 3
Size is 4
45 5 4 2
true
Vector::at() : index is out of range(Heap underflow)
Vector::at() : index is out of range(Heap underflow)


Approach-1: 


We have introduced the heap data structure in the above post and discussed heapify-up, push, heapify-down, and pop operations. In this post, the implementation of the max-heap and min-heap data structure is provided. Their implementation is somewhat similar to std::priority_queue.Max Heap implementation in C++:
