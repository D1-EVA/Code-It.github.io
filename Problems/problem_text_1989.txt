Given N x M character matrix A of O's and X's, where O = white, X = black.
Return the number of black shapes. A black shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included)

Input Format:
    The First and only argument is a N x M character matrix.


Output Format:
    Return a single integer denoting number of black shapes.


Constraints:
    1 <= N,M <= 1000
    A[i][j] = 'X' or 'O'


Example:
Input 1:
    A = [ OOOXOOO
          OOXXOXO
          OXOOOXO  ]
Output 1:
    3
