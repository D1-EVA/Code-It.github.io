There are two tribes in Mars, Lie tribe and Truth Tribe.
Lie tribe always speaks lie, True tribe always speaks truth.
You meet three mars people and ask from the first Person:
Q: What tribe do you belong to?


He replies something in his language which you dont understand.
Second person tells you that he is saying that he belongs to Lie Tribe.
Third person says that second person is lying.
What tribe does the third person belong to?
