Given a string A, partition A such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of A.

Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains the string A.


Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.


Constraints:
1 <= length(A) <= 501


Examples:
Input 1:
    A = "aba"

Output 1:
    0

Explanation 1:
    "aba" is already a palindrome, so no cuts are needed.

Input 2:
    A = "aab"
    
Output 2:
    1

Explanation 2:
    Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
