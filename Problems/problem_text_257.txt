1330. Reverse Subarray To Maximize Array ValueHard33534Add to ListShareYou are given an integer array nums. The value of this array is defined as the sum of |nums[i] - nums[i + 1]| for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1.
You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can perform this operation only once.
Find maximum possible value of the final array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3,1,5] the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] whose value is 10.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,9,24,2,1,10]
Output: 68


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
