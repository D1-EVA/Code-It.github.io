Given an array constructed from another array A by taking the sum of every distinct pair in it, decode it to get the original array A back.

Example: 


{
(A[0] + A[1]), (A[0] + A[2]),  (A[0] + A[n-1]),
(A[1] + A[2]), (A[1] + A[3]),  (A[1] + A[n-1]),


(A[i] + A[i+1]), (A[i] + A[i+2]),  (A[i] + A[n-1]),


(A[n-2] + A[n-1])
}


Approach-1: 

The idea is to calculate the first element of the original array by using the following relation:A[0] = (inp[0] + inp[1] - inp[n-1]) / 2
