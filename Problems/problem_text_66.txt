1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal RowsMedium53138Add to ListShareYou are given an m x n binary matrix matrix.
You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from 0 to 1 or vice versa).
Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.


Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is either0 or 1.

We want rows X with X ^ K = all 0s or all 1s.  This is the same as X = X^K ^K = (all 0s or all 1s) ^ K, so we want to count rows that have opposite bits set.  For example, if K = 1, then we count rows X = (00000...001, or 1111....110).
