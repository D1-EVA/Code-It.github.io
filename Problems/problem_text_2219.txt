Given a limited range array of size n containing elements between 1 and n-1 with one element repeating, find the duplicate number in it without using any extra space.

Example: 


Input: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 }
Output: The duplicate element is 4


Input: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 2 }
Output: The duplicate element is 2


Approach-1: 

Approach 1: Using HashingThe idea is to use hashing to solve this problem. We can use a visited boolean array to mark if an element is seen before or not. If the element is already encountered before, the visited array will return true.

Approach 2

Approach 2: Using Array Indices

Approach 3

Approach 3: Using XOR

Approach 4

Approach 4: Using Difference in Sum
