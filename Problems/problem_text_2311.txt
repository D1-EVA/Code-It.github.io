Given a list containing future predictions of share prices, find the maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares at most twice with a constraint that a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction complete, i.e., we can only hold at most one share at a time.

Example: 


Input: Stock prices are {2, 4, 7, 5, 4, 3, 5}
Output: The maximum profit is 7

Buy at a price 2 and sell at a price 7
Buy at a price 3 and sell at a price 5


Input: Stock prices are {10, 6, 8, 4, 2}
Output: The maximum profit is 2

Buy at a price 6 and sell at a price 8


Input: Stock prices are {8, 7, 6, 4}
Output: The maximum profit is 0

Buying and selling stock will result in loss


Approach-1: 

There are several variations to the above problem:
If we are allowed to stock only once, then we can find the maximum difference between two elements in the array, where the smaller element appears before the larger element.
If we are allowed to stock shares at most k times, we can follow the approach discussed here.
If we are allowed to stock shares any number of times, we can follow the approach discussed here.
