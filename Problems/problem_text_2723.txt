Given a linked list of integers, rearrange it such that every second node of the linked list is greater than its left and right nodes. In other words, rearrange the linked list node in alternating high-low.

Example: 


Input: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7
Output: 1 > 3 > 2 > 5 > 4 > 7 > 6


Input: 9 > 6 > 8 > 3 > 7
Output: 6 > 9 > 3 > 8 > 7


Input: 6 > 9 > 2 > 5 > 1 > 4
Output: 6 > 9 > 2 > 5 > 1 > 4


Approach-1: 

The idea is to start from the second node in the linked list and advance two nodes in each iteration of the loop. If the previous node is greater than the current node, swap their values. Similarly, if the next node is greater than the current node, exchange both values. At the end of the loop, we will get the desired linked list that satisfies the given constraints.Following is the C, Java, and Python implementation of the idea:
