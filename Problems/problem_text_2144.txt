You are given the root of a binary tree A.
You have to find the vertical sum of the tree.
A vertical sum denotes an array of sum of the different verticals of a binary tree,
where the leftmost vertical sum is the first element of the array and rightmost vertical is the last.

Constraints: 

1 <= Number of nodes in the binary tree <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 103

Input Format: 

The first argument is the root of a binary tree A.

Output Format: 

Return an array denoting the vertical sum of the binary tree.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A =     1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7

Input 2:
A =     1
       /
      2
     /
    3




Example Output: 

Output 1:
[4, 2, 12, 3, 7]

Output 2:
[3, 2, 1]




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The element 4 is present in the leftmost vertical. 
The middle vertical consists of 3 elements 1, 5, 6.
The resultant array is [4, 2, 12, 3, 7].
Explanation 2:
The leftmost vertical is the element 3. The next verticals are 2 and 1.
Hence, the resultant array is [3, 2, 1].
