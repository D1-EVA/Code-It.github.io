A spider is trying to build a web for itself. The web built by it doubles every day.
If the spider entirely built the web in 15 days, how many days did it take for the spider to build 25% of the web?

Answer is an integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
