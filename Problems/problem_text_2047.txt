Given a string A, find the common palindromic sequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous and is a pallindrome), which is common in itself.
You need to return the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.
NOTE:
Your code will be run on multiple test cases (<=10). Try to come up with an optimised solution.

Constraints: 

 1 <= |A| <= 1005

Input Format: 

First and only argument is an string A.

Output Format: 

Return a integer denoting the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = "bebeeed"



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 4



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 The longest common pallindromic subsequence is "eeee", which has a length of 4
