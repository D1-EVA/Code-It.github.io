Given two integers A and B, where A is the first element of the sequence then find Bth element of the sequence.If the kth element of the sequence is X then k+1th element calculated as:

if X is even then next element is X/2.
else next element is 3X + 1.


Constraints: 

1 <= A <= 1091 <= B <= 105

Input Format:
