Given two strings A and B. Find the longest common sequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous), which is common in both the strings.
You need to return the length of such longest common subsequence.


Constraints: 

1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1005

Input Format: 

First argument is an string A.
Second argument is an string B.


Output Format: 

Return the length of such longest common subsequence between string A and string B.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = "abbcdgf"
 B = "bbadcgf"



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 5



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 The longest common subsequence is "bbcgf", which has a length of 5
