An integer interval [X, Y] (for integers X < Y) is a set of all consecutive integers from X to Y, including X and Y.
You are given a 2D array A with dimensions N x 2, where each row denotes an interval.
Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval Z in A, the intersection of S with Z has a size of at least two.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i][0] < A[i][1] <= 109

Input Format: 

The first argument is a 2D integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the minimum size of S.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]

Input 2:
A = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
3

Output 2:
5




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.
Explanation 2:
An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
