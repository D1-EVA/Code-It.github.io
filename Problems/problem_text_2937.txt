Given two strings, determine whether they are anagrams.

Example: 


silent = listen
incest = insect


Approach-1: 

A simple solution would be to sort given strings. If the strings become equal after sorting, they are anagrams. The time complexity of this solution is O(n.log(n)), where n is the length of the input string.
We can also solve this problem in O(n) time. The idea is to maintain the frequency of each character of the first string in a map or a count array. Then for each character of the second string, decrement its frequency and return false if the frequency becomes negative or the character is not present on the map.
