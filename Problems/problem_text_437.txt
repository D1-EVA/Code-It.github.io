1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd SumMedium77233Add to ListShareGiven an array of integers arr, return the number of subarrays with an odd sum.
Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All subarrays are [[1],[1,3],[1,3,5],[3],[3,5],[5]]
All sub-arrays sum are [1,4,9,3,8,5].
Odd sums are [1,9,3,5] so the answer is 4.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,4,6]
Output: 0
Explanation: All subarrays are [[2],[2,4],[2,4,6],[4],[4,6],[6]]
All sub-arrays sum are [2,6,12,4,10,6].
All sub-arrays have even sum and the answer is 0.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: 16


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 100
