1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by kMedium96258Add to ListShareGiven an array of integers arr of even length n and an integer k.
We want to divide the array into exactly n / 2 pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by k.
Return true If you can find a way to do that or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,6),(2,5) and(3,4).

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: You can try all possible pairs to see that there is no way to divide arr into 3 pairs each with sum divisible by 10.


Constraints:

arr.length == n
1 <= n <= 105
n is even.
-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 105
