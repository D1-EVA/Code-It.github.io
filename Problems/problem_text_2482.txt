Given the root of a special binary tree with each node containing an additional next pointer, link nodes at the same level using the next pointer in the form of a linked list like structure.

Approach-1: 

We can solve this problem in linear time by using hashing. The idea is to traverse the tree in a preorder fashion and store nodes present at each level in a map from left to right. After every node is processed, iterate through the map, and for each level, set the next node for every node present in it.Following is the C++, Java, and Python program that demonstrates it:

Approach 2

How can we solve this using constant space?
