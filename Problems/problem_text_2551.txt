The Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) is finding the shortest supersequence Z of given sequences X and Y such that both X and Y are subsequences of Z.

Example: 


Consider the two following sequences, X and Y:
X: ABCBDAB
Y: BDCABA

The length of the SCS is 9
SCS are ABCBDCABA, ABDCABDAB, and ABDCBDABA


Approach-1: 

1. Finding the Shortest Common SupersequenceThe idea is to fill the lookup table of SCS by finding the length of SCS of given sequences, X[0m-1] and Y[0n-1], in a bottom-up manner and then recursively find the SCS in a top-down manner using values in the lookup table, i.e., follow the path from the bottom-right corner of lookup table to its top-left corner when reading out an SCS.
