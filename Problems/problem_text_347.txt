1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K ComparisonsHard40810Add to ListShareYou are given three integers n, m and k. Consider the following algorithm to find the maximum element of an array of positive integers:

You should build the array arr which has the following properties:

arr has exactly n integers.
1 <= arr[i] <= m where (0 <= i < n).
After applying the mentioned algorithm to arr, the value search_cost is equal to k.

Return the number of ways to build the array arr under the mentioned conditions. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2, m = 3, k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible arrays are [1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 1], [3, 2] [3, 3]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, m = 2, k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no possible arrays that satisify the mentioned conditions.

Example 3:
Input: n = 9, m = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50
1 <= m <= 100
0 <= k <= n

Build dp table where dp[a][b][c] is the number of ways you can start building the array starting from index a where the search_cost = c and the maximum used integer was b.Show Hint 2Recursively, solve the small sub-problems first. Optimize your answer by stopping the search if you exceeded k changes.
