1641. Count Sorted Vowel StringsMedium274460Add to ListShareGiven an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.
A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.

Example 3:
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50

Build a recursive function count(n, last_character) that counts the number of valid strings of length n and whose first characters are not less than last_character.Show Hint 3In this recursive function, iterate on the possible characters for the first character, which will be all the vowels not less than last_character, and for each possible value c, increase the answer by count(n-1, c).
