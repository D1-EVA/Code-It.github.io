A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Write an efficient algorithm to construct a full binary tree from a given preorder and postorder sequence.

Example: 


Input:

Preorder traversal : { 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 7 }
Postorder traversal: { 4, 5, 2, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 1 }


Output: Following full binary tree


Approach-1: 

We can construct a unique binary tree from inorder and preorder sequences and the inorder and postorder sequences. But preorder and postorder sequences dont provide enough information to create a unique binary tree. Several binary trees can be constructed due to ambiguity.For example, consider the following skewed trees:
