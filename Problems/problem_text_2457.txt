Given a normal binary tree, convert it into a Leftchild rightsibling (LCRS) binary tree.

Approach-1: 

The idea is to traverse the tree in a postorder fashion and for every node,
If its left child is empty, then make its right child as lefts and set right to null.
If the left child already exists, then make the right child of its left child point to its right child and set the right child to null.
