Given a source vertex s from a set of vertices V in a weighted digraph where all its edge weights w(u, v) are non-negative, find the shortest path weights d(s, v) from source s for all vertices v present in the graph.

Example: 





Vertex
Minimum Cost
Route


A > B
4
A > E > B


A > C
6
A > E > B > C


A > D
5
A > E > D


A > E
3
A > E





Approach-1: 

We know that the Breadthfirst search (BFS) can be used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph or even in a weighted graph having the same cost of all its edges. But if edges in the graph are weighted with different costs, then BFS generalizes to uniform-cost search. Instead of expanding nodes to their depth from the root, uniform-cost search expands the nodes in order of their cost from the root. A variant of this algorithm is known as Dijkstras algorithm.
Dijkstras Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other node. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the fastest route to the destination node has been determined.
