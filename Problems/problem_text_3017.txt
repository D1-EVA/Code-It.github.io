Lexicographic sorting: Given a set of strings, return them in lexicographic order (dictionary/alphabetical order).

Approach-1: 

Lexicographic sorting of a set of keys can be accomplished with a simple Trie-based algorithm as follows:
Insert all keys into a Trie.
Print all keys in the Trie by performing preorder traversal on Trie to get output in lexicographically increasing order.
