1306. Jump Game IIIMedium267966Add to ListShareGiven an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at startindex of the array. When you are at index i, you can jumpto i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0.
Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: 
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 

Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0
Output: true 
Explanation: 
One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is: 
index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

Example 3:
Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= arr[i] <arr.length
0 <= start < arr.length
