1 <= B <= 1000000




Input Format: 

First argument is the array A.
Second argument is integer B.




Output Format: 

Return one integer, the answer to the problem.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [2, 3]
B = 3



Input 2:












A = [1, 4]
B = 2










Example Output: 

Output 1:
7



Output 2:












7










Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 First you serve the seat with number = 3. Then with 2 and then with 2. hence answer = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.
