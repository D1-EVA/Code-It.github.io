Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n each where m >= n and X[] has exactly n vacant cells, merge elements of Y[] in their correct position in array X[], i.e., merge (X, Y) by keeping the sorted order.

Example: 


Input:

X[] = { 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0 }
Y[] = { 1, 8, 9, 10, 15 }

The vacant cells in X[] is represented by 0

Output:

X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 }


Approach-1: 

The idea is simple  move non-empty elements of X[] at the beginning of X[] and then merge X[] with Y[] starting from the end. The merge process is similar to the merge routine of the merge sort algorithm.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C, Java, and Python:
