1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by KMedium973801Add to ListShareGiven a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.
Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.

Example 2:
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.

Example 3:
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= 105

We only need to store remainders modulo K.Show Hint 2If we never get a remainder of 0, why would that happen, and how would we know that?
