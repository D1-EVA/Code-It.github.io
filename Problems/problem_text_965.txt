2148. Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements Easy2607Add to ListShareGiven an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
