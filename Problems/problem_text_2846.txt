Flood fill (also known as seed fill) is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array.

Example: 


BFS (starting-pixel, replacement-color):

Create an empty queue.
Enqueue starting pixel and mark it as processed.

Loop till queue is empty

Dequeue the front node and process it.
Replace the color of the current pixel (popped node) with that of the replacement.
Process all eight adjacent pixels of the current pixel and enqueue each valid pixel that has the same color as that of the current pixel.





Approach-1: 

Approach 1: (Using BFS)A queue-based implementation using Breadthfirst search (BFS) is shown below in pseudocode.

Approach 2

Approach 2: (Using DFS)
