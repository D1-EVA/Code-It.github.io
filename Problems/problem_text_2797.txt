Find duplicate rows present in a given binary matrix by traversing the matrix only once.

Example: 


Input:

[10010]
[01100]
[10010]
[00110]
[01100]

Output: {3, 5}

Explanation: Row #3 is duplicate of row #1 and row #5 is duplicate of row #2


Approach-1: 

Approach 1 (Using Trie)The idea is to insert each row of the given binary matrix into a binary Trie. The alphabet size of a binary trie is only limited to Boolean numbers (0 and 1). If a row is seen before (i.e., it is already present in the Trie), report it as duplicate.
