1496. Path CrossingEasy4819Add to ListShareGiven a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

Example 2:

Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

Constraints:

1 <= path.length <= 104
path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.
