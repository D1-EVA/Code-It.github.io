1505. Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On DigitsHard31520Add to ListShareYou are given a string num representing the digits of a very large integer and an integer k. You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the integer at most k times.
Return the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string.

Example 1:

Input: num = "4321", k = 4
Output: "1342"
Explanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.

Example 2:
Input: num = "100", k = 1
Output: "010"
Explanation: It's ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.

Example 3:
Input: num = "36789", k = 1000
Output: "36789"
Explanation: We can keep the number without any swaps.


Constraints:

1 <= num.length <= 3 * 104
num consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
1 <= k <= 104
