Given a graph with A nodes.The edges in graph are given in a 2D array B.There is an undirected edge between B[i][0] and B[i][1].Find the number of connected components in the given graph.

Constraints: 

1 <= A <= 1051 <= |B| <= 1051 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A

Input Format: 

First argument is an integer A.Second argument is a 2D integer array B.

Output Format: 

Return an integer.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 4
B = [[1, 2],
     [2, 3]]

Input 2:
A = 3
B = [1, 2]
    [2, 1]


Example Output: 

Output 1:
2
Output 2:
2

Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 The two connected components are [1, 2, 3] and [4].

Explanation 2:
The two connected components are [1, 2] and [3].
