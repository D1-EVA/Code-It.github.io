1200. Minimum Absolute DifferenceEasy150258Add to ListShareGiven an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.
Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

a, b are from arr
a < b
b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr


Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]
Output: [[1,3]]

Example 3:
Input: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]
Output: [[-14,-10],[19,23],[23,27]]


Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 105
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
