Given an integer array, find the maximum sum among all subarrays possible.

Example: 


Input: nums[] = [2, -4, 1, 9, -6, 7, -3]

Output: The maximum sum of the subarray is 11 (Marked in Green)


Approach-1: 

A naive solution is to consider every possible subarray, find the sum, and take the maximum. The problem with this approach is that its worst-case time complexity is O(n2), where n is the size of the input.Following is the C, Java, and Python program that demonstrates it:

Approach 2

The idea is to use Divide and Conquer technique to find the maximum subarray sum. The algorithm works as follows:
