Given a 2D character matrix A of size N x M, containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.



Constraints: 

1 <= N, M <= 103

Input Format: 

First and only argument 2D character matrix A of size N X M.

Output Format: 

Make changes to the the input only as matrix is passed by reference.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [  [X, X, X, X],
        [X, O, O, X],
        [X, X, O, X],
        [X, O, X, X]
     ]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
 A = [  [X, X, X, X],
        [X, X, X, X],
        [X, X, X, X],
        [X, O, X, X]
     ]




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 'O' in (4,2) is not surrounded by X from below.
