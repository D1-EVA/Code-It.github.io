Youve got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay him. The gold bar is segmented into seven connected pieces.

You must give them a piece of gold at the end of every day. What are the fewest number of cuts to the bar of gold that will allow you to pay him 1/7th each day?

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
