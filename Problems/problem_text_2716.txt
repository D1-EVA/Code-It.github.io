Given a linked list, rearrange its nodes such that alternate positions are filled with nodes starting from the beginning and end of the list. in linear time and constant space.

Example: 


Input : 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6
Output: 1 > 6 > 2 > 5 > 3 > 4


Input : 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7
Output: 1 > 7 > 2 > 6 > 3 > 5 > 4


Approach-1: 

We can easily solve this problem by dividing it into three subproblems:
Divide the list into two equal parts.
Reverse the second half.
Merge the second half into the first half at alternate positions. Use of extra space is not allowed (Not allowed to create additional nodes), i.e., insertion must be done in-place.
