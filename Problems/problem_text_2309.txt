In this post, we will see how to left-rotate an array by specified positions. For example, left-rotating array { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } twice results in array { 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 }.

Approach-1: 

1. Rotating r timesThe idea is to left-rotate all array elements by one position r times, where r is the given rotation count. This approach is demonstrated below in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

2. Using Auxiliary Array

Approach 3

3. By reversing array
