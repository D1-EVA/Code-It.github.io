Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

A height balanced BST : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example :

Given A : 1 -> 2 -> 3
A height balanced BST  :

      2
    /   \
   1     3
