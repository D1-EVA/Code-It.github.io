1952. Three DivisorsEasy22916Add to ListShareGiven an integer n, return true if n has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return false.
An integer m is a divisor of n if there exists an integer k such that n = k * m.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104
