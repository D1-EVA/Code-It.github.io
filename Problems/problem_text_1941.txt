Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
Tell us the 2 values swapping which the tree will be restored.

Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

Example :

Input : 
         1
        / \
       2   3

Output : 
       [1, 2]

Explanation : Swapping 1 and 2 will change the BST to be 
         2
        / \
       1   3
which is a valid BST
