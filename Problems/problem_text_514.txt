b'162. Find Peak ElementMedium59893719Add to ListShareA peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If\xc2\xa0the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -\xe2\x88\x9e.
You must write an algorithm that runs in\xc2\xa0O(log n) time.
\xc2\xa0
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
\xc2\xa0
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
