Given an unsorted integer array, find a triplet with a given sum in it.

Example: 


Input:

nums = [ 2, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5, 1, 3 ]
target = 6

Output: Triplet exists.

The triplets with the given sum 6 are {0, 1, 5}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3}


Approach-1: 

The problem is a standard variation of the 3SUM problem, where instead of looking for numbers whose sum is 0, we look for numbers whose sum is any constant C.1. Naive Recursive Approach

Approach 2

2. Using Hashing

Approach 3

3. Printing distinct triplets
