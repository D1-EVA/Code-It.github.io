b"1732. Find the Highest AltitudeEasy78583Add to ListShareThere is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

Example 1:
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

Example 2:
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.

Constraints:

n == gain.length
1 <= n <= 100
-100 <= gain[i] <= 100
