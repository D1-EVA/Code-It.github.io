1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of OccurrencesEasy35011Add to ListShareGiven a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.
A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.
