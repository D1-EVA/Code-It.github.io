Given a linked list and a positive integer k, find the k'th node from the end of the list.

Approach-1: 

Iterative SolutionA simple solution is to calculate the total number of nodes n in the linked list first. Then, the k'th node from the end will be (n-k+1)'th node from the beginning.

Approach 2

The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 3

Recursive Solution
