1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a SubstringMedium617298Add to ListShareGiven a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules:

The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters.
The substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.
It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
1 <= maxLetters <= 26
1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
