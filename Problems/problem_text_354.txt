1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an IntegerMedium140190Add to ListShareYou are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:

Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.

Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively.
Return the max difference between a and b.

Example 1:
Input: num = 555
Output: 888
Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888

Example 2:
Input: num = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8


Constraints:

1 <= num <= 108
