Given a non-empty integer array, find the index of the maximum occurring element with an equal probability.

Approach-1: 

The problem looks complicated at first look but has a straightforward solution. Following is the algorithm:

Store the count of each element of the input in a map.
Traverse the map and find the first maximum occurring element.
Generate a random number k between 1 and the count of the maximum occurring element.
Traverse the input and return the index of the k'th occurrence of the maximum occurring element.
