Given a binary tree, write an efficient algorithm to find the maximum sum root-to-leaf path, i.e., the maximum sum path from the root node to any leaf node in it.

Approach-1: 

The problem can be divided further into two subproblems:

Calculate the maximum sum from the root node to any leaf node in a binary tree.
Print root-to-leaf path having maximum sum in a binary tree.
