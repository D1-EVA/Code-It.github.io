Given a huge set of words with duplicates present and a positive integer k, find the first kmaximum occurring words in it.

Example: 


Input:

keys = [code, coder, coding, codable, codec, codecs, coded, codeless, codec, codecs, codependence, codex, codify, codependents, codes, code, coder, codesign, codec, codeveloper, codrive, codec, codecs, codiscovered]

k = 4

Output:

codec occurs 4 times
codecs occurs 3 times
code occurs 2 times
coder occurs 2 times
