Depthfirst search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root for a graph) and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Example: 


procedure preorder(treeNode v)
{
visit(v);
for each child u of v
preorder(u);
}
