1191. K-Concatenation Maximum SumMedium91286Add to ListShareGiven an integer array arr and an integer k, modify the array by repeating it k times.
For example, if arr = [1, 2] and k = 3 then the modified array will be [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
Return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. Note that the length of the sub-array can be 0 and its sum in that case is 0.
As the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2], k = 3
Output: 9

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,-2,1], k = 5
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-1,-2], k = 7
Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= k <= 105
-104 <= arr[i] <= 104
