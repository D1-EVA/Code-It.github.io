You have 12 balls all look identical (in shape, color etc.). 
All of them have same weight except one defective ball. 
You dont know that the defective one is heavier or lighter than other balls. You can use a two sided balance system (not the electronic one).
Find the minimum no. of measures required to separate the defective ball.

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
