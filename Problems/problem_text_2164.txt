Given N x N matrix filled with 0, 1, 2, 3.
Find whether there is a path possible from source to destination, traversing through blank cells only.  
You can traverse up, down, right, and left. Return a single integer 1 if a path exists, otherwise 0.

A value of cell 1 means Source.
A value of cell 2 means Destination.
A value of cell 3 means Blank cell.
A value of cell 0 means Blank Wall.
Note: there are an only a single source and single destination(sink). 

Constraints: 

2 <= N <= 103
0 <= Ai, j <= 3

Input Format: 

The first argument is the 2D integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer 1 if a path exists, otherwise 0.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [[1, 0], [0, 2]]

Input 2:
A = [[1, 3], [3, 2]]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
0

Output 2:
1




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The source is blocked by walls on all its sides. So, there is no way to reach the destination.
Explanation 2:
We can take any possible path to reach the destination from the source.
