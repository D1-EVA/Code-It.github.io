Given a positive integer n, print all combinations of numbers between 1 and n having sum n.

Example: 


For n = 5, the following combinations are possible:

{ 5 }
{ 1, 4 }
{ 2, 3 }
{ 1, 1, 3 }
{ 1, 2, 2 }
{ 1, 1, 1, 2 }
{ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }


For n = 4, the following combinations are possible:

{ 4 }
{ 1, 3 }
{ 2, 2 }
{ 1, 1, 2 }
{ 1, 1, 1, 1 }


Approach-1: 

We can use recursion to solve this problem. The idea is to consider every integer i from 1 to n and add it to the output and recur for remaining elements [in] with reduced sum n-i. To avoid printing permutations, each combination will be constructed in non-decreasing order. If a combination with the given sum is reached, print it.Following is the C, C++, Java, and Python implementation of the idea:
