1227. Airplane Seat Assignment ProbabilityMedium370674Add to ListSharen passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

Take their own seat if it is still available, and
Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied

Return the probability that the nth person gets his own seat.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: The first person can only get the first seat.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

f(1) = 1 (base case, trivial)
f(2) = 1/2 (also trivial)Show Hint 2Try to calculate f(3), f(4), and f(5) using the base cases. What if the value of them?
f(i) for i >= 2 will also be 1/2.Show Hint 3Try to proof why f(i) = 1/2 for i >= 2.
