Given an undirected connected graph, check if it contains any cycle or not using the unionfind algorithm.

Example: 


1. Create disjoint sets for each vertex of the graph.
2. For every edge u, v in the graph
i) Find the root of the sets to which elements u and v belongs.
ii) If both u and v have the same root in disjoint sets, a cycle is found.
