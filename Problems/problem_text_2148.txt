Given an integer array A, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 105

Input Format: 

First argument is array of integers A.

Output Format: 

Return an array of integers which satisfies above property.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]

Input 2:
A = [0]



Example Output: 

Ouput 1:
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Ouput 2:
[0]



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Shift all zeroes to the end.
Explanation 2:
There is only one zero so no need of shifting.
