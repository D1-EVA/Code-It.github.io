1546. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals TargetMedium74616Add to ListShareGiven an array nums and an integer target, return the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to target.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [1,1,1,1,1] with sum equals to target(2).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,3,5,1,4,2,-9], target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 subarrays with sum equal to 6.
([5,1], [4,2], [3,5,1,4,2,-9]) but only the first 2 are non-overlapping.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
0 <= target <= 106
