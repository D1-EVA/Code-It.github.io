166. Fraction to Recurring DecimalMedium15782957Add to ListShareGiven two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.
If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.
It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than 104 for all the given inputs.

Example 1:
Input: numerator = 1, denominator = 2
Output: "0.5"

Example 2:
Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 1
Output: "2"

Example 3:
Input: numerator = 4, denominator = 333
Output: "0.(012)"


Constraints:

-231 <=numerator, denominator <= 231 - 1
denominator != 0

Still remember how to perform a long division?Show Hint 2Try a long division on 4/9, the repeating part is obvious. Now try 4/333. Do you see a pattern?Show Hint 3Notice that once the remainder starts repeating, so does the divided result.Show Hint 4Be wary of edge cases! List out as many test cases as you can think of and test your code thoroughly.
