Given a binary tree, determine if two given nodes are cousins of each other or not. Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins of each other only if they have different parents, but they are at the same level.

Example: 


(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6) and (5, 7) are cousins of each other.
(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (4, 3), etc., are not cousins of each other.


Approach-1: 

The idea is to search for given nodes in a binary tree by doing inorder traversal on the tree and store their level and parent node. If both nodes are present at the same level and have different parents, they are cousins. If their level is different, or they are a sibling, they cannot be cousins.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python:
