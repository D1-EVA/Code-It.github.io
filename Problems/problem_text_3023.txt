Given a dictionary of words where each word follows a CamelCase notation, find all words in it that matches a given pattern of all uppercase characters.

Example: 


dict = [Hi, HiTech, HiTechCity, Hello, HelloWorld, HiTechLab]


If the pattern is HT, the output is [HiTech, HiTechCity, HiTechLab].
If the pattern is HTC, the output is [HiTechCity].
If the pattern is H, the output is the same as the input.



Approach-1: 

We can use a Trie data structure to solve this problem. The idea is to insert all uppercase characters of each word in the CamelCase dictionary into a Trie. In contrast, the complete word is stored in a container associated with the corresponding leaf node. After the complete dictionary is processed, traverse the Trie and find all words that match the given pattern.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python:
