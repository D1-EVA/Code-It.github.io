Given a binary matrix where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, and connected ones form an island, count the total islands.

Example: 


int row[] = { -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 }
int col[] = { -1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1 }


Approach-1: 


The solution is inspired by finding the total number of connected components in a graph problem. The idea is to start Breadthfirst search (BFS) from each unprocessed node and increment the island count. Each BFS traversal will mark all cells which make one island as processed. So, the problem reduces to finding the total number of BFS calls.In each BFS traversal, start by creating an empty queue. Then enqueue the starting cell and mark it as processed. Next dequeue the front node, process all eight adjacent cells of the current cell, and enqueue each valid cell, which is land. Repeat this process till the queue is not empty.
