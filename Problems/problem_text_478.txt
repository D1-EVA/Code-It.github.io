1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array SortedMedium101033Add to ListShareGiven an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty) from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.
Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].

Example 2:
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 109
