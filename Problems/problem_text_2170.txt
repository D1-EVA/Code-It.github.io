You are given a 2D string array A of dimensions N x 2,
where each row consists of two strings: first is the name of the student, second is their marks.
You have to find the maximum average mark. If it is a floating point, round it down to the nearest integer less than or equal to the number.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105

Input Format: 

The first argument is a 2D string array A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer which is the highest average mark.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [["Bob", "80"], ["Bob", "90"], ["Alice", "90"]]

Input 2:
A = [["Bob", "80"], ["Bob", "90"], ["Alice", "90"], ["Alice", "10"]]




Example Output:
