Given an integer A.Swap the Bth and Cth bit from right in binary representation of A.Return the integer formed.

Constraints: 

1 <= A < 2301 <= B, C <= 30

Input Format: 

First argument is an integer A.Second argument is an integer B.Third argument is an integer C.

Output Format: 

Return an integer.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 9
B = 1
C = 2

Input 2:
A = 1
B = 1
C = 3


Example Output: 

Output 1:
10
Output 2:
4

Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
5 -> 101
Swapping 1st and 2nd bit from right gives 110.

Explanation 2:
1 -> 001
Swapping 1st and 3rd bit from right gives 100.
