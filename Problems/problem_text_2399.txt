Given a set S, generate all distinct subsets of it, i.e., find distinct power set of set S. A power set of any set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.

Example: 



{} (also known as the empty set or the null set).
{x}
{y}
{x}
{x, y}
{x, x}
{y, x}
{x, y, x}



Approach-1: 

Approach 1: Using RecursionThe problem is very similar to the 0/1 knapsack problem, where for each element in set S, we have two options:
