1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning TreeHard46043Add to ListShareGiven a weighted undirected connected graph with nvertices numbered from 0 to n - 1,and an array edgeswhere edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodesaiand bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cyclesand with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called acritical edge. Onthe other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.


Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 3
0 <= ai < bi < n
1 <= weighti<= 1000
All pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
