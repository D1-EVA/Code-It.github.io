1504. Count Submatrices With All OnesMedium1519119Add to ListShareGiven an m x n binary matrix mat, return the number of submatrices that have all ones.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: 
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.
There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.
Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation: 
There are 8 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 5 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x3. 
There are 4 rectangles of side 2x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 2x2. 
There are 2 rectangles of side 3x1. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x2. 
Total number of rectangles = 8 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24.


Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 150
