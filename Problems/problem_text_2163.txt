You are given an integer array A of length N.
For every integer X in the array, you have to find out the number of integers Y, 
such that 1 <= Y <= X, and the number of divisors of Y is a power of 2.
For example, 6 has the following divisors - [1, 2, 3, 6]. This is equal to 4, which is a power of 2.
On the other hand, 9 has the following divisors [1, 3, 9] which is 3, which is not a power of 2.
Return an array containing the answer for every X in the given array.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Amax <= 106
Sum of Amax over all test cases will not exceed 5 * 106

Input Format: 

The first argument is the integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return an array containing the answer for every X in the given array.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [1, 4]

Input 2:
A = [5, 10]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
[1, 3]

Output 2:
[4, 8]




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The numbers 1, 2, 3 have the required number of divisors.
Explanation 2:
Only 4 and 9 are the numbers less than or equal to 10 which do not have the required number of divisors.
