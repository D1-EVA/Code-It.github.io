Given a rectangular field with few sensors present, cross it by taking the shortest safe route without activating the sensors.

Example: 


Go Up: (x, y) > (x  1, y)
Go Left: (x, y) > (x, y  1)
Go Down: (x, y) > (x + 1, y)
Go Right: (x, y) > (x, y + 1)


Approach-1: 


The idea is to use Breadthfirst search (BFS) since it is the shortest path problem. Following is the complete algorithm:
Create a queue and enqueue every safe cell of the first column and set their distance as 0 from the source (itself). Also, mark them as visited as we enqueue them.
Loop till queue is empty

Dequeue the front node.
If the popped node is the destination node (last column), return its distance.
Otherwise, for each of four adjacent cells of the current cell, enqueue each valid cell with +1 distance and mark them as visited.


If all the queue nodes are processed, and the destination is not reached, then return false.
