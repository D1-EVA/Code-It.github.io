Find the longest common prefix (LCP) in a given set of strings.

Example: 


Input:

keys = [codable, code, coder, coding]

Output:

The longest common prefix is cod


Approach-1: 

In the below post, we have discussed a solution using the divide-and-conquer technique to solve the LCP problem. In this post, a Trie-based solution is discussed.Longest Common Prefix (LCP) Problem
