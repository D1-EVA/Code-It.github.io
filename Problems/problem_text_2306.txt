Given a limited range array of size n and containing elements between 1 and n+1 with one element missing, find the missing number without using any extra space.

Example: 


Input: { 3, 2, 4, 6, 1 }
Output: The missing element is 5

Input: { 3, 2, 4, 5, 6 }
Output: The missing element is 1

Input: { 3, 2, 4, 5, 1 }
Output: The missing element is 6


Approach-1: 

The idea is to calculate the sum of all array elements. Then the missing number is the sum of elements between 1 and n+1 minus the actual sum, i.e., the missing number is:(1 + 2  + n + (n+1)) - (arr[0] + arr[1] +  + arr[n-1])

Approach 2



Approach 3

To check if a missing number lies in range 1 to n or not, mark array elements as negative by using array elements as indexes. For each array element arr[i], get the absolute value of element abs(arr[i]) and make the element at index abs(arr[i])-1 negative. Finally, traverse the array again to find the first index, which has a positive value. If a positive number is found at index i, then the missing number is i+1. If no positive element is found, then the missing number is n+1.
