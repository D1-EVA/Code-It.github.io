Given an N  N matrix of non-negative integers, where each cell of the matrix (i, j) indicates the direct flight cost from the city i to city j. Find the minimum cost to reach the destination city N-1 from the source city 0.

Example: 


Input: The cost matrix for 4 cities:

[02030100]
[2001575]
[3015050]
[10075500]

Output: The minimum cost is 80.

The minimum cost path is:

city 0 > city 2 (cost = 30)
city 2 > city 3 (cost = 50)


Input: The cost matrix for 5 cities:

[0252010105]
[200158080]
[301507090]
[1010500100]
[40505100]


Output: The minimum cost is 100.

The minimum cost path is:

city 0 > city 3 (cost = 10)
city 3 > city 1 (cost = 10)
city 1 > city 4 (cost = 80)


Approach-1: 

The idea is to recur for all cities reachable from the source city and consider their minimum cost. The recurrence relation T(0) can be written as:
T(n) = minimum { T(i) + cost[i][n] }
for all cities i between source city 0 and destination city n
