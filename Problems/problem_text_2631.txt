Given an undirected graph, determine whether it is bipartite using DFS. A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.

Approach-1: 

It is possible to test whether a graph is bipartite or not using a Depthfirst search (DFS) algorithm. There are two ways to check for bipartite graphs:
A graph is bipartite if and only if it is 2colorable.
A graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle.
