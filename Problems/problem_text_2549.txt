Implement your diff utility, i.e., given two similar strings, efficiently list out all differences between them.

Example: 


Input:

string X = XMJYAUZ
string Y = XMJAATZ

Output:

X M J -Y A -U +A +T Z

(- indicates that character is deleted from Y but it was present in X)
(+ indicates that character is inserted in Y but it was not present in X)
