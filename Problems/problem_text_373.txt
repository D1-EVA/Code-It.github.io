1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another ListMedium250193Add to ListShareGiven the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).
Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorites companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.

Example 1:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["google","microsoft"],["google","facebook"],["google"],["amazon"]]
Output: [0,1,4] 
Explanation: 
Person with index=2 has favoriteCompanies[2]=["google","facebook"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] corresponding to the person with index 0. 
Person with index=3 has favoriteCompanies[3]=["google"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] and favoriteCompanies[1]=["google","microsoft"]. 
Other lists of favorite companies are not a subset of another list, therefore, the answer is [0,1,4].

Example 2:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["leetcode","amazon"],["facebook","google"]]
Output: [0,1] 
Explanation: In this case favoriteCompanies[2]=["facebook","google"] is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"], therefore, the answer is [0,1].

Example 3:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode"],["google"],["facebook"],["amazon"]]
Output: [0,1,2,3]


Constraints:

1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100
1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500
1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20

The total complexity will be O(n^2 * m) where n is the number of lists and m is the maximum number of elements in a list.
