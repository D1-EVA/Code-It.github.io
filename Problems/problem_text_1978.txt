For Given Number N find if its COLORFUL number or not
Return 0/1
COLORFUL number:
A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. 
Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. 
And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different


Example:
N = 23
2 3 23
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
23 -> 6
this number is a COLORFUL number since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different. 

Output : 1
