Given a dictionary of ancient origin where the words are arranged alphabetically, find the correct order of alphabets in the ancient language.

Example: 


Input: Ancient dictionary { , , , , ,  }

Output: The correct order of alphabets in the ancient language is {     }.

Since the input is small, more than one ordering is possible. Another such ordering is {     }.


Input: Ancient dictionary { , , , ,  }

Output: The correct order of alphabets in the ancient language is {    }.

The alphabets {, , } are not included in the order as they are not properly defined.
