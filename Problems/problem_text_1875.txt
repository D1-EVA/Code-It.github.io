Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 2 3 ... n.
Make sure the combinations are sorted.
To elaborate,

Within every entry, elements should be sorted. [1, 4] is a valid entry while [4, 1] is not.
Entries should be sorted within themselves.

Example :
If n = 4 and k = 2, a solution is:
[
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4],
  [2,3],
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
]



Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING COMBINATIONS.
Example : itertools.combinations in python.
If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.
