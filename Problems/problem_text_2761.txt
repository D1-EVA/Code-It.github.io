Given an M  N matrix, which is row-wise and column-wise sorted, count the total number of negative elements present in it in linear time.

Example: 


Input:

[-7-3-135]
[-3-2246]
[-11358]
[34789]

Output:

The total number of negative elements present is 6.


Approach-1: 

We can do a binary search to find the last occurrence of a negative number or the first occurrence of a positive number for each row. The complexity of this solution will be O(M  log(N)), which is not linear as per problem time constraints.
The idea is to take advantage of the fact that the matrix is row-wise and column-wise sorted. Start from the matrixs top-rightmost cell and do the following until the matrix boundary is reached:
