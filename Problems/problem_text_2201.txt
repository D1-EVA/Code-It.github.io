You rolled a dice K times and got a sum of A after summing all the values you got after a roll.Find the number of ways you could have got a sum of A after rolling K times, since this value can be very large return modulo 109+7.

Constraints: 

1 <= A <= 106

Input Format: 

Given an integer A.

Output Format: 

Return and integer.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 2

Input 2:
A = 3


Example Output: 

Output 1:
2
Output 2:
4

Example Explanation:
