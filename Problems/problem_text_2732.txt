Given a linked list, reverse every alternate group of k nodes where k is a given positive integer.

Example: 


Input List: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > null


For k = 2,
Output List: 2 > 1 > 3 > 4 > 6 > 5 > 7 > 8 > 10 > 9 > null


For k = 3,
Output List: 3 > 2 > 1 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 10 > null


For k = 1,
Output List: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > null


For k >= 10,
Output List: 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1 > null


Approach-1: 

1. Iterative SolutionThe idea is to traverse the linked list and consider every group of 2k nodes at a time. In a single iteration of the loop, reverse the first k nodes and skip the next k nodes. Special care has to be taken while linking reversed groups with the rest of the list.

Approach 2

2. Recursive Solution
