Write an iterative program to reverse a string in C++ and Java.

Example: 


Input: Hello, World

Output: dlroW ,olleH


Approach-1: 




Approach 2

Following is the C++ and Java implementation of the idea:

Approach 3

The above solution takes O(n) for stack data structure which is not recommended. We can easily solve this problem in linear time and constant space. Following is the iterative in-place solution in C++ and Java:
