Activity Selection Problem: Given a set of activities, along with the starting and finishing time of each activity, find the maximum number of activities performed by a single person assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

Example: 


Input: Following set of activities

(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (3, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (2, 13), (12, 14)

Output:

(1, 4), (5, 7), (8, 11), (12, 14)


Approach-1: 

The activity selection problem is a problem concerning selecting non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame, given a set of activities each marked by a start and finish time. A classic application of this problem is scheduling a room for multiple competing events, each having its time requirements (start and end time).
Lets assume there exist n activities each being represented by a start time si and finish time fj. Two activities i and j are said to be non-conflicting if si = fj or sj = fi.
