728. Self Dividing NumbersEasy1150349Add to ListShareA self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right].

Example 1:
Input: left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
Example 2:
Input: left = 47, right = 85
Output: [48,55,66,77]


Constraints:

1 <= left <= right <= 104
