Given a schedule containing the arrival and departure time of trains in a station, find the minimum number of platforms needed to avoid delay in any trains arrival.

Example: 


Trains arrival = { 2.00, 2.10, 3.00, 3.20, 3.50, 5.00 }
Trains departure = { 2.30, 3.40, 3.20, 4.30, 4.00, 5.20 }

The minimum platforms needed is 2


The train arrived at 2.00 on platform 1
The train arrived at 2.10 on platform 2
The train departed at 2.30 from platform 1
The train arrived at 3.00 on platform 1
The train departed at 3.20 from platform 1
The train arrived at 3.20 on platform 1
The train departed at 3.40 from platform 2
The train arrived at 3.50 on platform 2
The train departed at 4.00 from platform 2
The train departed at 4.30 from platform 1
The train arrived at 5.00 on platform 1
The train departed at 5.20 from platform 1


Approach-1: 

The idea is to merge the arrival and departure times of trains and consider them in sorted order. Maintain a counter to count the total number of trains present at the station at any point. The counter also represents the total number of platforms needed at that time.
If the train is scheduled to arrive next, increase the counter by one and update the minimum platforms needed if the count is more than the minimum platforms needed so far.
If the train is scheduled to depart next, decrease the counter by 1.
