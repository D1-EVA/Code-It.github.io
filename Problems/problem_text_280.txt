1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple SumsHard64774Add to ListShareYou are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: target = [9,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Start with arr = [1, 1, 1] 
[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
[9, 3, 5] Done

Example 2:
Input: target = [1,1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].

Example 3:
Input: target = [8,5]
Output: true


Constraints:

n == target.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= target[i] <= 109

Thus, we can simulate the process in a reversed way.Show Hint 2Subtract the largest with the rest of the array, and put the new element into the array. Repeat until all elements become one
