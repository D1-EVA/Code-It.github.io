You are given an array A of strings and we have to serialize it and return the serialized string.
Serialization: Scan each element in a string, calculate its length and append it with a string and a element separator or deliminator (the deliminator is ~). We append the length of the string so that we know the length of each element.
For example, for a string 'interviewbit', its serialized version would be 'interviewbit12~'.


Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 1000
1 <= |Ai| <= 1000
Ai only contains lowercase english alphabets.


Input Format: 

The first argument A is the string array A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the serialized string.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = ['scaler', 'academy']

Input 2:
A = ['interviewbit']




Example Output: 

Output 1:
scaler6~academy7~

Output 2:
interviewbit12~




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Length of 'scaler' is 6 and academy is 7. So, the resulting string is scaler6~academy7~.
Explanation 2:
Explained in the description above.
