4-sum problem: Given an unsorted integer array, check if it contains four elements tuple (quadruplets) having a given sum.

Example: 


Input:

nums = [ 2, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5, 1, 3 ]
target = 20

Output: Quadruplet exists.

Below are quadruplets with the given sum 20

(0, 4, 7, 9)
(1, 3, 7, 9)
(2, 4, 5, 9)


Approach-1: 

1. Naive Recursive ApproachThe idea is similar to the 01 Knapsack problem and uses recursion. For each item, either consider it or exclude it and recur for the remaining items. Return true if the desired sum is found by including or excluding the current item.

Approach 2

2. Efficient solution using Hashing
