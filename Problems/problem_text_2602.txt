Given a list containing future predictions of share prices, find the maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares at most k times with a constraint that a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction is complete, i.e., we can only hold at most one share at a time.

Example: 



Input:
Stock Price: {2, 4, 7, 5, 4, 3, 5}
k = 2

Output: The maximum profit is 7 (sum of 5 and 2)

Buy at a price 2 and sell at a price 7
Buy at a price 3 and sell at a price 5


Input:
Stock Price: {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5}
k = 3

Output: The maximum profit is 10 (sum of 4, 5 and 1)

Buy at a price 1 and sell at a price 5
Buy at a price 2 and sell at a price 7
Buy at a price 4 and sell at a price 5


Input:
Stock Price: {10, 6, 8, 4, 2}
k = 2

Output: The maximum profit is 2

Buy at a price 6 and sell at a price 8


Input:
Stock Price: {10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2}
k = 1

Output: The maximum profit is 0


Approach-1: 

There are several variations to the above problem:
If we are allowed to stock only once, then we can find the maximum difference between two elements in the array, where the smaller element appears before the larger element.
If we are allowed to stock shares at most twice, we can follow the approach discussed here.
If we are allowed to stock shares any number of times, we can follow the approach discussed here.
