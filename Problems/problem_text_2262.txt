Given an unsorted integer array, print all distinct four elements tuple (quadruplets) in it, having a given sum.

Example: 


Input:

A[] = [2, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5, 1, 3]
target = 20

Output: Below are the quadruplets with sum 20

(0, 4, 7, 9)
(1, 3, 7, 9)
(2, 4, 5, 9)


Approach-1: 

In the previous post, we have discussed how to check if an array contains a quadruplet or not. In this post, we will print all distinct quadruplets present in an array.
We start by sorting the given array in ascending order and then for each pair (A[i], A[j]) in the array where i < j, check if a quadruplet is formed by the current pair and a pair from subarray A[j+1n). Refer to this post to find pairs with a given sum in a sorted array in linear time.
