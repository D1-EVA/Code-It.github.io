Given a binary tree, perform vertical traversal on it. In a vertical traversal, nodes of a binary tree are processed in vertical order from left to right. Assume that the left and right child makes a 45degree angle with the parent.

Example: 


(horizontal distance > Nodes)

-1 > [2, 7]
0 > [1, 5]
1 > [3, 8]
2 > [6]


Approach-1: 

We can easily solve this problem with the help of hashing. This post provides an overview of some available alternatives to accomplish this using hashing.1. Using Preorder Traversal

Approach 2

2. Using Level Order Traversal
