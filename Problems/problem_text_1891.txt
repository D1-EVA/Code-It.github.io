A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or NULL.
Return a deep copy of the list.
Example
Given list
   1 -> 2 -> 3


with random pointers going from
  1 -> 3
  2 -> 1
  3 -> 1


You should return a deep copy of the list. The returned answer should not contain the same node as the original list, but a copy of them. The pointers in the returned list should not link to any node in the original input list.
