Given a binary array A and a number B, we need to find length of the longest subsegment of 1s possible by changing at most B 0s.

Constraints: 

 1 <= N, B <= 105
 A[i]=0 or A[i]=1


Input Format: 

First argument is an binary array A.
Second argument is an integer B.


Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the length of the longest subsegment of 1s possible by changing at most B 0s.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
 B = 1

Input 2:
 A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
 B = 2



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 4

Output 2:
 5



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 Here, we should only change 1 zero(0). Maximum possible length we can get is by changing the 3rd zero in the array,
 we get a[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}

Explanation 2:
 Here, we can change only 2 zeros. Maximum possible length we can get is by changing the 3rd and 4th (or) 4th and 5th zeros.
