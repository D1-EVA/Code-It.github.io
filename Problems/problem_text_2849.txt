Given a positive number n, efficiently generate binary numbers between 1 and n using the queue data structure in linear time.

Example: 


1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 10000


Approach-1: 

Following is the C++, Java, and Python implementation:

Approach 2


We can also use std::bitset in C++, as shown below:
