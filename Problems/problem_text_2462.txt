Given a binary tree, write a recursive algorithm to print all paths from every leaf node to root node in the binary tree.

Example: 


4 > 2 > 1
5 > 2 > 1
8 > 6 > 3 > 1
9 > 6 > 3 > 1
7 > 3 > 1


Approach-1: 

The idea is to traverse the tree in a preorder fashion and store every encountered node in the current path from the root-to-leaf in a list. If we encounter a leaf node, print all nodes present in the list in reverse order.Following is the C++, Java, and Python program that demonstrates it:
