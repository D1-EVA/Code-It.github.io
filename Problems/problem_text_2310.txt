In this post, we will see how to right-rotate an array by specified positions. For example, right rotating array { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 } three times will result in array { 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4 }.

Approach-1: 

1. Rotating k timesThe idea is to right-rotate all array elements by one position k times, where k is the given rotation count. This approach is demonstrated below in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

2. Using Auxiliary Array

Approach 3

3. By reversing array
