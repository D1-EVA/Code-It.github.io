Given m sorted lists, each containing n elements, print them efficiently in sorted order.

Example: 


Input: 5 sorted lists of fixed size 4

[10, 20, 30, 40]
[15, 25, 35, 45]
[27, 29, 37, 48]
[32, 33, 39, 50]
[16, 18, 22, 28]

Output:

[10, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 45, 48, 50]
