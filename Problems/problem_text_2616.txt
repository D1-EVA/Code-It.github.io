Given an N  N matrix of integers, find the maximum sum submatrix present in it.

Example: 


submatrix sum = S[j+1][n+1]  S[j+1][m]  S[i][n+1] + S[i][m]


Approach-1: 


The idea is to preprocess the matrix. We take an auxiliary matrix S[][], where S[i][j] will store the sum of elements in the matrix from (0, 0) to (i-1, j-1). The idea is similar to the following post:Calculate the sum of all elements in a submatrix in constant time
