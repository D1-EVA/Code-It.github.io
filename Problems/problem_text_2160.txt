You are given A dices with faces numbered from 1 to B.
You have to find out the number of ways to get to sum C.
Since, the number can be large, output the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints: 

1 <= A, B, C <= 103

Input Format: 

The first argument is the integer A.
The second argument is the integer B.
The third argument is the integer C.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the number of ways to get to the required sum modulo 109 + 7.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 2
B = 4
C = 5

Input 2:
A = 2
B = 4
C = 1




Example Output: 

Output 1:
4

Output 2:
0




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
There are 4 different ways to arrange the dices - [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 1].
Explanation 2:
Since, the dices are numbered from 1. 2 dices will have the minimum sum of 2. 
Therefore, there are zero ways to get to sum 1.
