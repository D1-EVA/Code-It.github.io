In this post, we will see how to reverse a doubly linked list using iteration and recursion.

Approach-1: 

1. Iterative SolutionThe idea is simple  Traverse the list and swap next and prev pointers for each node. Finally, update head pointer to point to the last node.

Approach 2

We can also solve this problem recursively by passing current node information in the recursion itself. This is demonstrated below in C, Java, and Python:
