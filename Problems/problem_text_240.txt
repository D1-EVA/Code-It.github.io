1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String PalindromeHard175126Add to ListShareGiven a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.
Return the minimum number of steps to make spalindrome.
APalindrome Stringis one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Example 1:
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.

Example 2:
Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".

Example 3:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
