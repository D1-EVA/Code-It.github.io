Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most 2 transactions.
Return the maximum possible profit.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Input Format:
The first and the only argument is an integer array, A.


Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.


Constraints:
1 <= length(A) <= 7e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7


Examples:
Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 1, 2]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1: 
    Day 0 : Buy 
    Day 1 : Sell
    Day 2 : Buy
    Day 3 : Sell

Input 2:
    A = [7, 2, 4, 8, 7]

Output 2:
