Given a positive number, check if it is a power of 8 or not.

Example: 


(0xB6DB6DB6)16 = (10110110110110110110110110110110)2


Approach-1: 

Approach 1A simple solution is to calculate log8n for a given number n. If it returns an integral value, then we can say that the number is a power of 8.

Approach 2

The given number n is the power of 8 if it is the power of 2, and its only set bit is present at (0, 3, 6,  , 30) position.
