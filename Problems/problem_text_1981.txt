Given a 2 x N grid of integer, A, choose numbers such that the sum of the numbers
is maximum and no two chosen numbers are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and return it.
Note: You can choose more than 2 numbers.
Input Format:
The first and the only argument of input contains a 2d matrix, A.


Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the maximum possible sum.


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= A[i] <= 2000


Example:
Input 1:
    A = [   [1]
            [2]    ]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1:
    We will choose 2.

Input 2:
    A = [   [1, 2, 3, 4]
            [2, 3, 4, 5]    ]
    
Output 2:
    We will choose 3 and 5.
