Given an integer array, find the largest subarray formed by consecutive integers. The subarray should contain all distinct values.

Example: 


Input: { 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 0 }

Output: The largest subarray is { 0, 2, 1, 4, 3 }


Approach-1: 

The problem differs from the problem of finding the longest subsequence formed by consecutive integers. Unlike subsequences, subarrays are required to occupy consecutive positions within the original array.
The idea is to consider every subarray and keep track of the largest subarray found so far, formed by consecutive integers. For a subarray to contain consecutive integers,
