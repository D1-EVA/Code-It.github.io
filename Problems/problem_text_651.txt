b"1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of OperationsMedium50816Add to ListShareYou are given two arrays of integers nums1 and nums2, possibly of different lengths. The values in the arrays are between 1 and 6, inclusive.
In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value between 1 and 6, inclusive.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in nums1 equal to the sum of values in nums2. Return -1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can make the sums of nums1 and nums2 equal with 3 operations. All indices are 0-indexed.
- Change nums2[0] to 6. nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].
- Change nums1[5] to 1. nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,1], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].
- Change nums1[2] to 2. nums1 = [1,2,2,4,5,1], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], nums2 = [6]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to decrease the sum of nums1 or to increase the sum of nums2 to make them equal.

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [6,6], nums2 = [1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can make the sums of nums1 and nums2 equal with 3 operations. All indices are 0-indexed. 
- Change nums1[0] to 2. nums1 = [2,6], nums2 = [1].
- Change nums1[1] to 2. nums1 = [2,2], nums2 = [1].
- Change nums2[0] to 4. nums1 = [2,2], nums2 = [4].
