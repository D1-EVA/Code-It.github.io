b'10. Regular Expression MatchingHard80591222Add to ListShareGiven an input string s\xc2\xa0and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for \'.\' and \'*\' where:

\'.\' Matches any single character.\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b
\'*\' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
\xc2\xa0
Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: \'*\' means zero or more of the preceding element, \'a\'. Therefore, by repeating \'a\' once, it becomes "aa".

Example 3:
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

\xc2\xa0
Constraints:

1 <= s.length\xc2\xa0<= 20
1 <= p.length\xc2\xa0<= 30
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, \'.\', and\xc2\xa0\'*\'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character \'*\', there will be a previous valid character to match.
