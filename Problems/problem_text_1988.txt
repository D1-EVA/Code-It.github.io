b'There are N Mice and N holes that are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.\nThe positions of Mice are denoted by array A and the position of holes are denoted by array B.\nA mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x \xe2\x88\x92 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.\nAssign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints: \n\n1 <= N <= 105\n-109 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109\n\n\n\nInput Format: \n\nFirst argument is an integer array A.\nSecond argument is an integer array B.\n\n\n\n\nOutput Format: \n\nReturn an integer denoting the minimum time when the last nouse gets inside the holes.\n\nExample Input: \n\nInput 1:\n A = [-4, 2, 3]\n B = [0, -2, 4]\nInput 2:\n A = [-2]\n B = [-6]\n\n\n\n\nExample Output: \n\nOutput 1:\n 2\nOutput 2:\n 4\n\n\n\n\nExample Explanation: \n\nExplanation 1:\n Assign the mouse at position (-4 to -2), (2 to 0) and (3 to 4).\n The number of moves required will be 2, 2 and 1 respectively.\n So, the time taken will be 2.\nExplanation 2:\n Assign the mouse at position -2 to -6.\n The number of moves required will be 4.\n So, the time taken will be 4.\n\n'
