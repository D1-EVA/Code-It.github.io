Given an integer, find its square without using multiplication and division operator. Also, the use of the power function from any programming language library is not allowed.

Example: 


12 = 1
22 = (1 + 3) = 4
32 = (1 + 3 + 5 = 9)
42 = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7) = 16


Approach 2

The idea is to repeatedly add a given number n to the result n times. For example,

Approach 3

If n is even, the square of n can be expressed as n2 = ((n/2)  2)2 = (n/2)2  4.
