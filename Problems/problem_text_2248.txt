Given an integer array, find the smallest window sorting which will make the entire array sorted in increasing order.

Example: 


Input: { 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 4, 8 }
Output: Sort the array from index 3 to 6


Input: { 1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4, 8 }
Output: Sort the array from index 1 to 6


Approach-1: 

We can easily solve this problem in linear time. Following is the complete algorithm:
Traverse array from left to right keeping track of maximum so far and note the last encountered index j which is less than the maximum so far.
Traverse array from right to left keeping track of minimum so far and note the last encountered index i, which is more than the minimum so far.
Finally, sort the array from index i to j.
