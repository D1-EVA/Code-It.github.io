This operation can be performed only once on an element of array.

Constraints: 

1<=|A|<=1e5
1<=A[i],x<=1e9


Input Format: 

First argument is array of integers .
Second argument is B which denotes the value of x.

Output Format: 

Return 1 if we can make all elements equal , otherwise return 0.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A=[2,3,1]
X=1

Input 2:
A=[2,3,1]
X=2



Example Output: 

Ouput 1:
1

Ouput 2:
0



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
WE can make all elements equal to 2.

Explanation 2:
There is no way to make all elements equal to 0.
