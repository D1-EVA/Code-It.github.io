First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.
Third argument is an integer C.
Fourth argument is an integer D.




Output Format: 

Return an array of size D denoting the first smallest D integers which only have A, B, C or a combination of them as their prime factors.
NOTE: You need to return the array sorted in ascending order.

Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 3
 C = 5
 D = 5





Example Output: 

Output 1:
 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
