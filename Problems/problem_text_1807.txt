Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and should also be sorted.
For example, given following linked lists :
  5 -> 8 -> 20 
  4 -> 11 -> 15


The merged list should be :
4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20
