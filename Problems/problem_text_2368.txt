Given a binary pattern containing ? wildcard character at a few positions, find all possible combinations of binary strings that can be formed by replacing the wildcard character by either 0 or 1.

Example: 


1011000010
1011000011
1011000110
1011000111
1011100010
1011100011
1011100110
1011100111
1111000010
1111000011
1111000110
1111000111
1111100010
1111100011
1111100110
1111100111


Approach-1: 

Recursive SolutionWe can easily solve this problem by using recursion. The idea is to process each character of the pattern one at a time and recur for the remaining pattern. If the current digit is 0 or 1, ignore it. If the current character is a wildcard character ?, replace it with 0 and 1, and recur for the remaining pattern.

Approach 2

We can also solve this problem iteratively using stack, queue, set, vector, or any other container. The idea remains the same. Start by processing each character of the pattern one at a time, but instead of recursing for the remaining pattern, push it into a container. At each iteration, pop a string from the container, find the first occurrence of wildcard pattern ? in it, replace ? with 0 and 1, and finally push it back into the container. If no wildcard pattern is found, print the popped string. Repeat this process until the container is empty.
