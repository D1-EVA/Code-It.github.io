2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given NumberMedium24970Add to ListShareGiven an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.

Example 1:
Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].

Example 2:
Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.


Constraints:

0 <= num <= 1015
