Given a collection of n items, each of which has a non-negative integer key whose maximum value is at most k, effectively sort it using the counting sort algorithm.

Approach-1: 

OverviewCounting sort is an integer-based sorting algorithm for sorting an array whose keys lie between a specific range. It counts the total number of elements with each distinct key value and then uses those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output.

Approach 2


Following is the simpler version of counting sort that doesnt produce a stable sort, i.e., the relative order of items with equal keys is not preserved anymore.
