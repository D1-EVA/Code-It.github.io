Given a stack, sort it using recursion. The use of any other data structures (like containers in STL or Collections in Java) is not allowed.

Example: 


Stack before sorting: 5 | -2 | 9 | -7 | 3where 3 is the top element
Stack after sorting: -7 | -2 | 3 | 5 | 9where 9 is the top element


Approach-1: 

The idea is simple  recursively remove values from the stack until the stack becomes empty and then insert those values (from the call stack) back into the stack in a sorted position.Following is the C++, Java, and Python implementation of the idea:
