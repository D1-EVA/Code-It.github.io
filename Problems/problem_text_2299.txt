Given an array of distinct integers, shuffle it according to the given order of elements.

Example: 


Input:

nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
pos[] = { 3, 2, 4, 1, 0 }

Output:

nums[] = { 5, 4, 2, 1, 3 }

i.e., if pos[i] = j, then update nums[j] = nums[i] for every index i.
In other words, update nums[pos[i]] = nums[i] for every index i.


Approach-1: 

A simple solution is to create an auxiliary array of size n, and for each element in the input array, set the corresponding values in it. After filling the auxiliary array, we copy it back to the given array. This solution can be implemented as follows in C, Java, and Python:
