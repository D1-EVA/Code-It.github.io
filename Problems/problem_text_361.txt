144. Binary Tree Preorder TraversalEasy4066130Add to ListShareGiven the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
