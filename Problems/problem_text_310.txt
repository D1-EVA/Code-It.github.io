1386. Cinema Seat AllocationMedium490261Add to ListShare
A cinemahas nrows of seats, numbered from 1 to nand there are tenseats in each row, labelled from 1to 10as shown in the figure above.
Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8is already reserved.
Return the maximum number of four-person groupsyou can assign on the cinemaseats. A four-person groupoccupies fouradjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3]and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional caseon which an aisle splita four-person group, in that case, the aisle splita four-person group in the middle,which means to have two people on each side.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
Output: 4


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^9
1 <=reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)
reservedSeats[i].length == 2
1<=reservedSeats[i][0] <= n
1 <=reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10
All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.
