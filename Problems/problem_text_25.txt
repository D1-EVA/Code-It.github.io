102. Binary Tree Level Order TraversalMedium8128159Add to ListShareGiven the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
