1734. Decode XORed PermutationMedium49218Add to ListShareThere is an integer array perm that is a permutation of the first n positive integers, where n is always odd.
It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]. For example, if perm = [1,3,2], then encoded = [2,1].
Given the encoded array, return the original array perm. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.

Example 1:
Input: encoded = [3,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]

Example 2:
Input: encoded = [6,5,4,6]
Output: [2,4,1,5,3]


Constraints:

3 <= n <105
nis odd.
encoded.length == n - 1
