777. Swap Adjacent in LR StringMedium805692Add to ListShareIn a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters, like "RXXLRXRXL", a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of "XL" with "LX", or replacing one occurrence of "RX" with "XR". Given the starting string start and the ending string end, return True if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.

Example 1:
Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output: true
Explanation: We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX

Example 2:
Input: start = "X", end = "L"
Output: false


Constraints:

1 <= start.length<= 104
start.length == end.length
Both start and end will only consist of characters in 'L', 'R', and'X'.
