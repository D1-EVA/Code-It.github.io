Breadthfirst search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a search key) and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next-level neighbors.

Approach-1: 




Approach 2

The recursive algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python:
