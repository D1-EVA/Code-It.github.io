The lexicographically minimal string rotation (or lexicographically least circular substring) is the problem of finding a strings rotation possessing the lowest lexicographical order among all possible rotations.

Approach-1: 


The idea is to iterate through successive rotations of the given string while keeping track of the most lexicographically minimal rotation encountered. Following is the C++, Java, and Python implementation of the idea:
