700. Search in a Binary Search TreeEasy3324151Add to ListShareYou are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.
Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
1 <= Node.val <= 107
root is a binary search tree.
1 <= val <= 107
