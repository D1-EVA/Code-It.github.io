You are given the root of a complete binary tree A.
You have to return the value of the rightmost node in the last level of the binary tree.
Try to find a solution with a better time complexity than O(N).

Constraints: 

1 <= Number of nodes in the binary tree <= 105

Input Format: 

The first argument is the root of a binary tree A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the value of the rightmost node in the last level of the binary tree.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 
    1
   /
  2

Input 2:
A = 
    1
   / \
  2   3




Example Output: 

Output 1:
2

Output 2:
3




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
There is only a single node in the last level of the binary tree.
Therefore, the answer is 2.
Explanation 2:
There a two nodes in the last level of the tree.
The rightmost nodes is 3.
