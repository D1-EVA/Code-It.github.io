Given an array A, maximize value of expression (A[s] - A[r] + A[q] - A[p]), where p, q, r, and s are indices of the array and s > r > q > p.

Example: 


Input: A[] = [3, 9, 10, 1, 30, 40]

Output: 46

Explanation: The expression (40  1 + 10  3) will result in the maximum value


Approach-1: 

A naive solution would be to generate all combinations of such numbers. The time complexity of this solution would be O(n4), where n is the size of the input.
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to create four lookup tables, first[], second[], third[], and fourth[], where:
