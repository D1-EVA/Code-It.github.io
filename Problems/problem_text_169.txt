1221. Split a String in Balanced StringsEasy1716751Add to ListShareBalanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
Return the maximum amount of split balanced strings.

Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
s is a balanced string.
