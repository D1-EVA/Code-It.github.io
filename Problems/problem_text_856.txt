2027. Minimum Moves to Convert StringEasy20946Add to ListShareYou are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.

Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.

Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.


Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'X' or 'O'.
