Constraints: 

1 <= Size of linked list <= 100000

Input Format: 

First and only argument is the head of the Linked-List A.

Output Format: 

Return the head of the new linked list.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4



Input 2:










A = 1 -> 2 -> 3









Example Output: 

Output 1:
 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2



Output 2:










 1 -> 2 -> 3
