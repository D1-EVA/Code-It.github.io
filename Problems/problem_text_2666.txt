Given a list of tasks with deadlines and total profit earned on completing a task, find the maximum profit earned by executing the tasks within the specified deadlines. Assume that each task takes one unit of time to complete, and a task cant execute beyond its deadline. Also, only a single task will be executed at a time.

Example:

Approach-1: 

We can easily solve this problem by following a Greedy approach. The idea is simple  consider each task decreasing order of their profits and schedule it in the latest possible free slot that meets its deadline. If no such slot is there, dont schedule the task.The following table shows the tasks arranged based on their associated profits. Here, task 5 has a maximum priority associated with it as it has a maximum gain of 30. Similarly, task 4 has the least priority. The greedy approach will consider the tasks in decreasing order of their priority.
