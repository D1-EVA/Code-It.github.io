Given a circularly sorted integer array, search an element in it. Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.

Example: 


Input:

nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
target = 10

Output: Element found at index 2


Input:

nums = [9, 10, 2, 5, 6, 8]
target = 5

Output: Element found at index 3
