Given a list containing future prediction of share prices, find the maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares any number of times with the constraint, a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction is complete, i.e., we can only hold at most one share at a time.

Example: 


Stock Prices: {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5}

Total profit earned is 10

Buy on day 1 and sell on day 2
Buy on day 3 and sell on day 5
Buy on day 7 and sell on day 8


Stock Prices: {10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2}

Total profit earned is 0


Approach-1: 

There are several variations to the above problem:
If we are allowed to stock only once, we can find the maximum difference between two elements in the array, where the smaller element appears before the larger element.
If we are allowed to stock shares at most twice, we can follow the approach discussed here.
If we are allowed to stock shares at most k times, we can follow the approach discussed here.
