1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings EqualMedium869207Add to ListShareYou are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length consisting of letters "x" and "y" only. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You can swap any two characters that belong to different strings, which means: swap s1[i] and s2[j].
Return the minimum number of swaps required to make s1 and s2 equal, or return -1 if it is impossible to do so.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "xx", s2 = "yy"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = "yx", s2 = "yx".

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "xy", s2 = "yx"
Output: 2
Explanation: Swap s1[0] and s2[0], s1 = "yy", s2 = "xx".
Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = "xy", s2 = "xy".
Note that you cannot swap s1[0] and s1[1] to make s1 equal to "yx", cause we can only swap chars in different strings.

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "xx", s2 = "xy"
Output: -1


Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
s1, s2 only contain 'x' or 'y'.

For the unmatched positions, there are three basic cases (already given in the examples):Show Hint 2("xx", "yy") => 1 swap, ("xy", "yx") => 2 swapsShow Hint 3So the strategy is, apply case 1 as much as possible, then apply case 2 if the last two unmatched are in this case, or fall into impossible if only one pair of unmatched left. This can be done via a simple math.
