Write an algorithm to generate any one of the given n numbers according to given probabilities.

Example: 


nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
probability[] = { 30, 10, 20, 15, 25 };// total probability should sum to 100%


Approach-1: 

Algorithm:

Construct a sum array S[] from the given probability array P[], where S[i] holds the sum of all P[j] for 0 <= j <= i.
Generate a random integer from 1 to 100 and check where it lies in S[].
Based on the comparison result, return the corresponding element from the input array.
