2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different ColorsEasy40912Add to ListShareThere are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.
Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.
The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.

Example 1:

Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

Example 2:

Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.

Example 3:
Input: colors = [0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.


Constraints:

n ==colors.length
2 <= n <= 100
0 <= colors[i] <= 100
Test data are generated such that at least two houses have different colors.

Can you try the combination of every two houses?Show Hint 2Greedily, the maximum distance will come from either the pair of the leftmost house and possibly some house on the right with a different color, or the pair of the rightmost house and possibly some house on the left with a different color.
