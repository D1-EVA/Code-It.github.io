852. Peak Index in a Mountain ArrayEasy26381634Add to ListShareLet's call an array arr a mountainif the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with0 < i< arr.length - 1such that:
	
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i-1] < arr[i] 
arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]



Given an integer array arr that is guaranteed to bea mountain, return anyisuch thatarr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1


Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
