Given a linked list and two positive integers, m and n, delete every n nodes after skipping m nodes.

Example: 


1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > null

If m = 1, n = 3

1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > null
1 > 5 > 9 > null


If m = 2, n = 2

1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > null
1 > 2 > 5 > 6 > 9 > 10 > null


Approach-1: 

The idea is to traverse the given list, skip the first m nodes, delete the next n nodes, and recur for the remaining nodes. The solution is simple, but we need to ensure that all boundary conditions are handled properly in the code.The implementation can be seen below in C, Java, and Python:
