Given a sorted array A containing N integers both positive and negative.
You need to create another array containing the squares of all the elements in A and return it in non-decreasing order.
Try to this in O(N) time.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105.
-103 <= A[i] <= 103


Input Format: 

First and only argument is an integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return a integer array as described in the problem above.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [-6, -3, -1, 2, 4, 5]

Input 2:
 A = [-5, -4, -2, 0, 1]



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

Output 2:
 [0, 1, 4, 16, 25]
