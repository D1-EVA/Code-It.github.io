Given an integer array A and two integers B and C.
You need to find the number of subarrays in which the number of occurrences of B is equal to number of occurrences of C.
NOTE: Don't count empty subarrays.



Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 104
1 <= A[i], B, C <= 108
 B != C



Input Format: 

First argument is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B.
Third argument is an integer C.



Output Format: 

Return an integer denoting the number of subarrays in which the number of occurrences of B is equal to number of occurrences of C.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 1]
 B = 1
 C = 2

Input 2:
 A = {1, 2, 1}
 B = 4
 C = 6




Example Output: 

Output 1:
 2

Output 2:
 6




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of B and C are:
    1) {1, 2}, B and C have same occurrence(1).
    2) {2, 1}, B and C have same occurrence(1).

Explanation 2:
 The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of B and C are:
    1) {1}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
    2) {2}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
    3) {1}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
    4) {1, 2}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
    5) {2, 1}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
    6) {1, 2, 1}, B and C have same occurrence(0).
