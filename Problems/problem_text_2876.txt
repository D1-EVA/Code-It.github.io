Given an integer array, sort it using the selection sort algorithm.

Approach-1: 


Following is an iterative implementation of the selection sort algorithm in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 2


The selection sort algorithm can be implemented recursively. Following is the recursive implementation of the selection sort algorithm in C, Java, and Python:
