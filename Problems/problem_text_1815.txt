b'Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in-place and in one-pass.\nFor example:\nGiven 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4,\nreturn 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.\n\nNote:\nGiven m, n satisfy the following condition:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 length of list.\nNote 2:\nUsually the version often seen in the interviews is reversing the whole linked list which is obviously an easier version of this question.\n\n'
