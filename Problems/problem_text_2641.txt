Given a directed graph, check if it is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or not. A DAG is a digraph (directed graph) that contains no cycles.

Example: 


Tree edge (u, v): departure[u] > departure[v]
Back edge (u, v): departure[u] < departure[v]
Forward edge (u, v): departure[u] > departure[v]
Cross edge (u, v): departure[u] > departure[v]
