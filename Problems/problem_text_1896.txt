Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note: You have to modify the array A to contain the merge of A and B. Do not output anything in your code.
TIP: C users, please malloc the result into a new array and return the result.

If the number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed should be m + n
Example :
Input : 
         A : [1 5 8]
         B : [6 9]

Modified A : [1 5 6 8 9]
