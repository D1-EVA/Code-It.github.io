There is a building of 100 floors
If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break. If its dropped from any floor below, it will not break. Youre given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.
These are very strong eggs, because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as they are dropped from floors below their threshold floor, floor N. But once an egg is dropped from a floor above its threshold floor, it will break.
Output the minimum number of drops required to figure out N.

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
