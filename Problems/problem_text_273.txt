1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings AnagramMedium122957Add to ListShareYou are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.
Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.
An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

Example 1:
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

Example 3:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s.length == t.length
s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.
