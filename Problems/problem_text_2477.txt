Given a binary tree where each node has one extra pointer next, set it to the inorder successor for all binary tree nodes.

Example: 


The inorder successor of node 4 is 2
The inorder successor of node 2 is 1
The inorder successor of node 1 is 7
The inorder successor of node 7 is 5
The inorder successor of node 5 is 8
The inorder successor of node 8 is 3
The inorder successor of node 3 is 6
The inorder successor of node 6 is null


Approach-1: 

The idea is to perform an inorder traversal of the tree and maintain the previously processed node for every tree node. Then set the next node to a previously visited node for every node in the inorder traversal. This approach is demonstrated below in C++, Java, and Python:
