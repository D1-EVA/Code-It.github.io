Given an integer array containing duplicates, return the majority element if present. A majority element appears more than n/2 times, where n is the array size.

Example: 


Initialize an element m and a counter i = 0

for each element x of the input sequence:
if i = 0, then
assign m = x and i = 1
else
if m = x, then assign i = i + 1
else
assign i = i  1
return m


Approach-1: 

1. Brute-Force SolutionA naive solution is to count each elements frequency in the first half of the array to check if it is the majority element. Following is the naive implementation:

Approach 2

3. BoyerMoore majority vote algorithm
