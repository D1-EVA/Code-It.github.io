Given a large number represent in the form of an integer array A, where each element is a digit.
You have to find whether there exists any permutation of the array A such that the number becomes divisible by 60.
Return 1 if it exists, 0 otherwise.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 105
0 <= Ai <= 9


Input Format: 

The first argument is an integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer '1' if there exists a permutation, '0' otherwise.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [0, 6]

Input 2:
A = [2, 3]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
1

Output 2:
0




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
We can rearrange the digits to form 60, which is divisible by 60.
Explanation 2:
There are only two possible permutations: [23, 32].
Both of them are not divisible by 60.
