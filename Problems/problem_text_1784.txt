A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
 'A' -> 1
 'B' -> 2
 ...
 'Z' -> 26

Given an encoded message A containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it modulo 109 + 7.


Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 105

Input Format: 

The first and the only argument is a string A.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer denoting the total number of ways to decode it modulo 109 + 7.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = "8"

Input 2:
 A = "12"



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 2



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 Given encoded message "8", it could be decoded as only "H" (8).
 The number of ways decoding "8" is 1.

Explanation 2:
 Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1, 2) or "L" (12).
 The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
