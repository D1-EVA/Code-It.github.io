Check if a given string can be derived from another string by circularly rotating it. The rotation can be in a clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation.

Example: 


Input:

X = ABCD
Y = DABC

Output: Yes

Y can be derived from X by right-rotating it by 1 unit


Approach-1: 

For two given strings X and Y, a simple solution would be to check if the string Y is a substring of the string XX or not. If yes, they can be derived from each other. For example, consider string X = ABCD and Y = DABC.XX = ABCD + ABCD = ABCDABCD
