1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks VisibleHard44410Add to ListShareThere are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly ksticks are visible from the left. A stickis visible from the left if there are no longersticks to the left of it.

For example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.

Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

Example 3:
Input: n = 20, k = 11
Output: 647427950
Explanation: There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.
