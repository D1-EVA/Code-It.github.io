Given an integer array A of size N containing 0's and 1's only.




You need to find the length of the longest subarray having count of 1sone more than count of 0s.


Note: In the subarray count of 1's should be one more than the count of 0's.


Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105

Input Format: 

First and only argument is an integer array A of size N.

Output Format: 

Return an integer denoting the longest length of the subarray.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Input 2:
 A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]





Example Output: 

Output 1:
 5
Output 2:
 1





Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 Subarray of length 5, index 1 to 5 i.e 1, 1, 0, 0, 1. Count of 1 = 3, Count of 0 = 2.
Explanation 2:
 Subarray of length 1 will be only subarray that follow the above condition.
