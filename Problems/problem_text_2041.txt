Our company wants to create a data entry verification system. 
Given an amount in words and an amount indicated by data entry person in numbers, you have to detect whether the amounts are same or not.
Note: There are a lot of corner cases to be considered. Interviewer expects you to take care of them.
Input:
String num: Amount written in digits as a string. This string will be an integer number without having any commas in between the digits.
String words: Amount written in words according to Indian Numbering System.


Output:
An integer
1: Values match
0: Otherwise


Please note :Every word needs to be separated using "-" rather than a space character
