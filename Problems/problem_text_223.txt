1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive NumbersMedium108382Add to ListShareGiven an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of k consecutive numbers.
Return true if it is possible. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3] , [2,3,4] , [3,4,5] and [9,10,11].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Each array should be divided in subarrays of size 3.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
