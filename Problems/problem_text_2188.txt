Given a string A consisting of only characters 'a' and 'b'.Divide the string into substrings of length B.Find the subtring with maximum count of 'a' and return the count.Note: If the length of the string is not a multiple of B and there are some characters left in the end consider them also as a substring.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 105Ai = {'a', 'b'}1 <= B <= 105

Input Format: 

First argument A is a string.Second argument is an integer B.

Output Format: 

Return an integer.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = "baab"
B = 2

Input 2:
A = "bba"
B = 2


Example Output: 

Output 1:
1

Output 2:
1


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The subtrings are "ba" and "ab".
Both have count of 'a' equal to 1.
Explanation 2:
The substrings are "bb" and "a".
"a" has the highest count which is 1.
