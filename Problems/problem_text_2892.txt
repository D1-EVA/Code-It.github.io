Given an integer array, sort its element by their frequency and index. i.e., if two elements have different frequencies, then the one which has more frequency should come first; otherwise, the one which has less index should come first.

Example: 


Input: [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8, 7, 8]

Output: [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 6, 7]


Approach-1: 

The idea is to write a custom comparison method to solve this problem. Let the two elements to be compared are x and y. Then
If x and y have different frequencies, then the one with more frequency should be treated as smaller than the other.
If x and y have the same frequencies, then the one with less index should be treated as smaller than the other.
