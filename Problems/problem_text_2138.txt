Given an N x M matrix A of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Blue lake" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Red lake" touches the right and bottom edges.
Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.
Find the number of cells from where water can flow to both the Blue and Red lake.


Constraints: 

1 <= M, N <= 1000
1 <= A[i][j] <= 109


Input Format: 

First and only argument is a 2D matrix A.

Output Format: 

Return an integer denoting the number of cells from where water can flow to both the Blue and Red lake.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [
       [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
       [3, 2, 3, 4, 4]
       [2, 4, 5, 3, 1]
       [6, 7, 1, 4, 5]
       [5, 1, 1, 2, 4]
     ]
Input 2:
 A = [
       [2, 2]
       [2, 2]
     ]



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 7
Output 2:
 4


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 Blue Lake ~   ~   ~   ~   ~ 
        ~  1   2   2   3  (5) *
        ~  3   2   3  (4) (4) *
        ~  2   4  (5)  3   1  *
        ~ (6) (7)  1   4   5  *
        ~ (5)  1   1   2   4  *
           *   *   *   *   * Red Lake
 Water can flow to both lakes from the cells denoted in parentheses.

Explanation 2:
 Water can flow from all cells.
