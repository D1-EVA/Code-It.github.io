b'We define f(X, Y) as number of different corresponding bits in binary representation of X and Y. For example, f(2, 7) = 2, since binary representation of 2 and 7 are 010 and 111, respectively. The first and the third bit differ, so f(2, 7) = 2.\nYou are given an array of N positive integers, A1, A2 ,\xe2\x80\xa6, AN. Find sum of f(Ai, Aj) for all pairs (i, j) such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 N. Return the answer modulo 109+7.\nFor example,\nA=[1, 3, 5]\n\nWe return\n\nf(1, 1) + f(1, 3) + f(1, 5) + \nf(3, 1) + f(3, 3) + f(3, 5) +\nf(5, 1) + f(5, 3) + f(5, 5) =\n\n0 + 1 + 1 +\n1 + 0 + 2 +\n1 + 2 + 0 = 8\n\n\n'
