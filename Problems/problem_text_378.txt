1458. Max Dot Product of Two SubsequencesHard58111Add to ListShareGiven two arrays nums1and nums2.
Return the maximum dot productbetweennon-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie,[2,3,5]is a subsequence of[1,2,3,4,5]while [1,5,3]is not).

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]
Output: 21
Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.
Their dot product is (3*7) = 21.
Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: Take subsequence [-1] from nums1 and subsequence [1] from nums2.
Their dot product is -1.

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500
-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
