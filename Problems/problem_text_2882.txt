Implement Quicksort efficiently for inputs containing many repeated elements.

Approach-1: 

We can use an alternative linear-time partition routine to solve this problem that separates the values into three groups:

The values less than the pivot,
The values equal to the pivot, and
The values greater than the pivot.
