Implement a heap data structure in Java.

Example: 


Output:

Priority queue size is 3
Priority queue contains 2

Emptying queue: 15 3 2
The queue is empty

Calling remove operation on an empty heap
java.lang.Exception: Index out of range(Heap underflow)
The element with the highest priority is null

Calling peek operation on an empty heap
java.lang.Exception: Index out of range (Heap underflow)
The element with the highest priority is null

Printing array: [45, 4, 5]

The element with the highest priority is 45
The element with the highest priority is 5

In the above post, we have introduced the heap data structure and covered heapify-up, push, heapify-down, and pop operations. In this post, Java implementation of Max Heap and Min Heap is discussed.1. Max Heap implementation in Java
