Given an integer, count its set bits.

Example: 


Input: n = -1 (111111)
Output: The total number of set bits in -1 is 32

Input: n = 16 (00001000)
Output: The total number of set bits in 16 is 1


Approach-1: 

1. Brute-Force SolutionA simple solution is to consider every bit (set or unset) in a number and maintain a counter to keep track of the set bits. This method is demonstrated below in C++, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

2. Using Brian Kernighans algorithm

Approach 3

3. Using GCC built-in function

Approach 4

4. Using std::bitset::count function
