Given a text, find all occurrences of a given pattern in it.

Example: 


1. For text T = ABCABAABCABAC and pattern P = ABAA,

The pattern occurs only once in the text, starting from index 3 (ABCABAABCABAC).


2. For text T = ABCABAABCABAC and pattern P = CAB,

The pattern occurs twice in the text, starting from index 2 and 8 (ABCABAABCABAC and ABCABAABCABAC).


Approach-1: 


The naive algorithm finds all occurrences of a pattern by using a loop that checks the condition
P[1m] = T[s+1s+m] for each of the n-m+1 possible values of s. Following is the pseudocode for the algorithm:
Naive-Pattern-Matching(T, P)

n = length[T]
m = length[P]

for s = 0 to n  m do
if P[1  m] = T[s+1  s+m] do
print Pattern is found at position s
end-if
end-for
