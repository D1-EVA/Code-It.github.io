Given a sorted array A consisting of duplicate elements.
 Your task is to remove all the duplicates and return a sorted array of distinct elements consisting of all distinct elements present in A.
But, instead of returning an answer array, you have to rearrange the given array in-place such that it resembles what has been described above.
Hence, return a single integer, the index(1-based) till which the answer array would reside in the given array A.
Note: This integer is the same as the number of integers remaining inside A had we removed all the duplicates.
Look at the example explanations for better understanding.





Input Format: 

First and only argurment containing the integer array A.










Output Format: 

Return a single integer, as per the problem given.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [1, 1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]









Example Output: 

Output 1:
2
Output 2:

3










Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Updated Array: [1, 2, X] after rearranging. Note that there could be any number in place of x since we dont need it.
We return 2 here.

Explanation 2:
Updated Array: [1, 2, 3, X, X] after rearranging duplicates of 2 and 3.
We return 3 from here.
