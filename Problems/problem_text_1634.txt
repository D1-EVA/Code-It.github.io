872. Leaf-Similar TreesEasy168255Add to ListShareConsider all the leaves of a binary tree, fromleft to right order, the values of thoseleaves form a leaf value sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similarif their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Example 1:

Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].
