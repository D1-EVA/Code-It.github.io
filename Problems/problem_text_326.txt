1400. Construct K Palindrome StringsMedium71672Add to ListShareGiven a string s and an integer k, return true if you can use all the characters in s to construct k palindrome strings or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "annabelle", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s.
Some possible constructions "anna" + "elble", "anbna" + "elle", "anellena" + "b"

Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of s.

Example 3:
Input: s = "true", k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: The only possible solution is to put each character in a separate string.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105
