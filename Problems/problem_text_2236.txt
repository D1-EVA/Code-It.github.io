Given an integer array, find the maximum difference between two elements in it such that the smaller element appears before the larger element.

Example: 


Input: { 2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5 }

Output: The maximum difference is 7.

The pair is (2, 9)


Approach-1: 

A naive solution is to consider every pair present in the array and keep track of the maximum difference found so far. Following is the C, Java, and Python program that demonstrates it:

Approach 2


We can solve this problem in linear time. The idea is to traverse the array from the right and keep track of the maximum difference found so far. If the current element is less than the maximum element found so far and their difference is more than the maximum difference found so far, update the maximum difference with the current difference.
