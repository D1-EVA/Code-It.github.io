Write an algorithm to replace each element in an array of positive integers such that the difference between adjacent elements in the array is less than or equal to a given target. The goal is to minimize the adjustment cost, which is the sum of differences between new and old values.

Example: 


Input: A = [1, 3, 0, 3], target = 1
Output: Minimum adjustment cost is 3

One of the possible solutions is [2, 3, 2, 3]


Input: A = [55, 77, 52, 61, 39, 6, 25, 60, 49, 47], target = 10
Output: Minimum adjustment cost is 75

One of the possible solutions is [55, 62, 52, 49, 39, 29, 30, 40, 49, 47]


Input: A = [2, 3, 2, 3], target = 1
Output: Minimum adjustment cost is 0

All adjacent elements in the input array are already less than equal to the given target.
