Given two integers, find the minimum number between them without using any conditional statement (or ternary operator).

Example: 


Case 1: When a is greater

(a > b)  b + (b > a)  a = 1  b + 0  a = b

Case 2: When b is greater

(a > b)  b + (b > a)  a = 0  b + 1  a = a


Approach-1: 




Approach 2

We can apply the above principle to the following code. Initially, min is a. Now if min > b is true, i.e., b is less than a, the second subexpression min = b will be evaluated and min will set to b; otherwise, if min > b is false, the second subexpression will not be evaluated and min will remain equal to a.

Approach 3

This approach is demonstrated below in C. This solution wont work on negative numbers.

int minimum (int a, int b){if (!a || !b) {return 0;}return 1 + minimum(--a, --b);}
