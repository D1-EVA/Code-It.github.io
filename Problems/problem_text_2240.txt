Given an integer array, find all distinct combinations of a given length k.

Example: 


Input: {2, 3, 4}, k = 2
Output: {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}


Input: {1, 2, 1}, k = 2
Output: {1, 2}, {1, 1}, {2, 1}


Approach-1: 


We can use recursion to solve this problem. The idea is to add each element to the output and recur for the remaining items with one less element. To avoid printing permutations, construct each tuple in the same order as array elements. Then if the combination of the given size is found, print it.The following solution in C++, Java, and Python generates all tuples using the above logic by traversing the array from left to right. To print only distinct combinations for inputs containing repeated elements, sort the array and exclude all adjacent duplicate elements from it.
