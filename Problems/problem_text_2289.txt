Write code to print all combinations of positive integers in increasing order that sum to a given positive number.

Example: 


Input: N = 3

1 1 1
1 2
3

Input: N = 4

1 1 1 1
1 1 2
1 3
2 2
4

Input: N = 5

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2
1 1 3
1 2 2
1 4
2 3
5


Approach-1: 

We can easily solve the problem using recursion by taking the help of an auxiliary array to store combinations. This approach is demonstrated below in C, Java, and Python:
