145. Binary Tree Postorder TraversalEasy4140141Add to ListShareGiven the root of abinary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
