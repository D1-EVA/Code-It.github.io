930. Binary Subarrays With SumMedium133545Add to ListShareGiven a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= goal <= nums.length
