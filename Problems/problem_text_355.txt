1433. Check If a String Can Break Another StringMedium509110Add to ListShareGiven two strings: s1 and s2 with the samesize, check if somepermutation of string s1 can breaksomepermutation of string s2 or vice-versa. In other words s2 can break s1or vice-versa.
A string xcan breakstring y(both of size n) if x[i] >= y[i](in alphabetical order)for all ibetween 0 and n-1.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xya"
Output: true
Explanation: "ayx" is a permutation of s2="xya" which can break to string "abc" which is a permutation of s1="abc".

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "abe", s2 = "acd"
Output: false 
Explanation: All permutations for s1="abe" are: "abe", "aeb", "bae", "bea", "eab" and "eba" and all permutation for s2="acd" are: "acd", "adc", "cad", "cda", "dac" and "dca". However, there is not any permutation from s1 which can break some permutation from s2 and vice-versa.

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "leetcodee", s2 = "interview"
Output: true


Constraints:

s1.length == n
s2.length == n
1 <= n <= 10^5
All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
