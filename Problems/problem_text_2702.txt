Rearrange a given linked list such that every even node will be moved to the end of the list in reverse order.

Example: 


Input: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > null

Output: 1 > 3 > 5 > 7 > 6 > 4 > 2 > null


Approach-1: 

The idea is to use the moveNode() function. The function takes a node from the front of the source and moves it to the destinations front. Here, the source node will be even nodes in the given list, and the destination will be a new list. After we have moved every even node, append the new list, which now contains the even nodes in reverse order to the original list.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C, Java, and Python:
