Given an undirected graph, check if it is bipartite or not. A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.

Approach-1: 

It is possible to test whether a graph is bipartite or not using a Breadthfirst search (BFS) algorithm. There are two ways to check for a bipartite graph:1. A graph is a bipartite graph if and only if it is 2colorable.
