A chips factory is packing chips in packets.The packets of chips are represented as an array A.Find the packet of chips which are empty (Ai = 0) and move them to the end of the array.Return the resultant array.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 1050 <= Ai <= 109

Input Format: 

Given an integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return an integer array.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Input 2:
A = [1, 0, 0, 0]


Example Output: 

Output 1:
[1, 2, 3, 0]

Output 2:
[1, 0, 0, 0]


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The only empty packet is at index 1 so we move it last of the array.
