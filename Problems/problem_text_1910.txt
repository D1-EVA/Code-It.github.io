Given two numbers represented as strings, return multiplication of the numbers as a string.

Note: The numbers can be arbitrarily large and are non-negative.
Note2: Your answer should not have leading zeroes. For example, 00 is not a valid answer.

For example, 
given strings "12", "10", your answer should be 120.
NOTE : DO NOT USE BIG INTEGER LIBRARIES ( WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN JAVA / PYTHON ). 
We will retroactively disqualify such submissions and the submissions will incur penalties.
