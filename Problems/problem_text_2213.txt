Given two integers A and B which represent an integer range [A, B].Find themaximum number of distinct palindromic integers we can take from the given range, such that the absolute difference between any two integers doesn't exceed C.

Constraints: 

1 <= A <= B <= 1051 <= C <= 105

Input Format: 

The first argument is an integer A.The second argument is an integer B.The third argument is an integer C.

Output Format: 

Return an integer.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 80
B = 110
C = 10

Input 2:
A = 1
B = 10
C = 10


Example Output: 

Output 1:
2
Output 2:
9

Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
The plaindromic integers are 88, 99, 101.
We will pick 99, 101.
Explanation 2:
The plaindromic integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
We can pick all the palindrome integers.
