You are given two strings A and B.
Check whether there exists any permutation of both A and B such that they are equal.
Return a single integer 1 if its exists, 0 otherwise.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A|, |B| <= 105
Both strings contain only lowercase english alphabets.

Input Format: 

The first argument is the string A.
The second argument is the string B.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer 1 if a permutation exists, 0 otherwise.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 'scaler'
B = 'relasc'

Input 2:
A = 'scaler'
B = 'interviewbit'




Example Output: 

Output 1:
1

Output 2:
0




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
We can rearrange the second string to 'scaler', hence, a permuation exists.
Explanation 2:
The given length of the two strings itself is different. There is no possible permutation.
