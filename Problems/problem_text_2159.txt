You are given a directed graph with A vertices and M edges.
You are given an array B with dimensions M x 2, where each row denotes a directed edge from Bi, 0 to Bi, 1.
You need to find if there exists a mother vertex in the given graph. Return 1 if it exists, otherwise 0.
A mother vertex is defined as a vertex from which all the vertices in the graph are accessible by a directed path.

Constraints: 

1 <= A <= 105
1 <= M <= 2 * 105
1 <= Bi, 0, Bi, 1 <= A
There can be duplicate edges or self loops in the input graph.


Input Format: 

The first argument is the integer A.
The second argument is the 2D integer array B.

Output Format: 

Return a single integer 1 if a mother vertex exists, otherwise 0.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 3
B = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 3]]

Input 2:
A = 3
B = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 2]]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
0

Output 2:
1




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
There is no vertex from which all the other vertices are accessible.
Note there can be duplicate edges.
Explanation 2:
Vertex 1 is the mother vertex. We can reach 2 using 1 -> 3 -> 2. We can reach 3 using 1 -> 3
