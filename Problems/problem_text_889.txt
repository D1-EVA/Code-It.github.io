2063. Vowels of All SubstringsMedium38715Add to ListShareGiven a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in every substring of word.
A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.

Example 1:
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".
- "b" has 0 vowels in it
- "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each
- "aba" has 2 vowels in it
Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. 

Example 2:
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c".
- "a", "ab", and "abc" have 1 vowel each
- "b", "bc", and "c" have 0 vowels each
Hence, the total sum of vowels = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Example 3:
Input: word = "ltcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no vowels in any substring of "ltcd".


Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 105
word consists of lowercase English letters.
