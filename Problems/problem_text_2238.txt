Given an integer array, find and print a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum in it.

Example: 


Input: {-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4}

Output: The contiguous subarray with the largest sum is {4, -1, 2, 1}


Input: {8, -7, -3, 5, 6, -2, 3, -4, 2}

Output: The contiguous subarray with the largest sum is {5, 6, -2, 3}


Approach-1: 

We can easily solve this problem in linear time by maintaining the maximum subarray sum ending at each array index. Then,

The subarray is either empty in which case its sum is zero, or
It consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous index.
