698. Partition to K Equal Sum SubsetsMedium4779311Add to ListShareGiven an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,3,5,2,1], k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: false


Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 16
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
The frequency of each element is in the range [1, 4].

Then, let's recursively search, where at each call to our function, we choose which of k subsets the next value will join.
