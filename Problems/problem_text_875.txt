2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced NumberMedium98221Add to ListShareAn integer x is numerically balanced if for every digit d in the number x, there are exactly d occurrences of that digit in x.
Given an integer n, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than n.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 22
Explanation: 
22 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 2 occurs 2 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1000
Output: 1333
Explanation: 
1333 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.

Example 3:
Input: n = 3000
Output: 3133
Explanation: 
3133 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.
