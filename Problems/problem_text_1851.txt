You have three jars that are all mislabeled. One contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily half-half mix).
How many minimum jelly beans would you have to pull out to find out how to fix the labels on the jars?
Labels on jars are as follows
Jar 1 : Peanut butter
Jar 2 : Grape
Jar 3 : P.b. / Grape



Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
