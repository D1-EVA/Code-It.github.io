1655. Distribute Repeating IntegersHard21815Add to ListShareYou are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array. You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:

The ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,
The integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and
Every customer is satisfied.

Return true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], quantity = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: The 0th customer cannot be given two different integers.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], quantity = [2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [3,3]. The integers [1,2] are not used.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], quantity = [2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [2,2].


Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
m == quantity.length
1 <= m <= 10
1 <= quantity[i] <= 105
There are at most 50 unique values in nums.

For example, if nums = [4,4,5,5,5], frequencies = [2,3].Show Hint 2Each customer wants all of their numbers to be the same. This means that each customer will be assigned to one number.Show Hint 3Use dynamic programming. Iterate through the numbers' frequencies, and choose some subset of customers to be assigned to this number.
