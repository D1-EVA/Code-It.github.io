1785. Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given SumMedium152145Add to ListShareYou are given an integer array nums and two integers limit and goal. The array nums has an interesting property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to goal. The array must maintain its property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,-1,1], limit = 3, goal = -4
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add -2 and -3, then the sum of the array will be 1 - 1 + 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,-10,9,1], limit = 100, goal = 0
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= limit <= 106
-limit <= nums[i] <= limit
-109 <= goal <= 109

Then you only need to form goal using elements whose absolute value is <= limit.Show Hint 2You can greedily set all of the elements except one to limit or -limit, so the number of elements you need is ceil(abs(goal)/ limit).Show Hint 3You can "normalize" goal by offsetting it by the sum of the array. For example, if the goal is 5 and the sum is -3, then it's exactly the same as if the goal is 8 and the array is empty.Show Hint 4The answer is ceil(abs(goal-sum)/limit) = (abs(goal-sum)+limit-1) / limit.
