1362. Closest DivisorsMedium19082Add to ListShareGiven an integer num, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equalsnum + 1or num + 2.
Return the two integers in any order.

Example 1:
Input: num = 8
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen.

Example 2:
Input: num = 123
Output: [5,25]

Example 3:
Input: num = 999
Output: [40,25]


Constraints:

1 <= num <= 10^9
