Given a directed graph, check if it is strongly connected or not. A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.

Approach-1: 

A simple solution is to perform Depthfirst search (DFS) or Breadthfirst search (BFS) starting from every vertex in the graph. If each DFS/BFS call visits every other vertex in the graph, then the graph is strongly connected.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

Can we do better?
