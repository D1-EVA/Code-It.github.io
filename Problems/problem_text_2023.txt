Given an 1D integer array A of length N, find the length of longest subsequence which is first increasing then decreasing.

Constraints: 

0 <= N <= 3000
 -107 <= A[i] <= 107


Input Format: 

The first and the only argument contains an integer array A.

Output Format: 

Return an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 1]

Input 2:
 A = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]



Example Output: 

Output 1:
 3

Output 2:
 6



Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 [1, 2, 1] is the longest subsequence.

Explanation 2:
 [1 2 10 4 2 1] is the longest subsequence.
