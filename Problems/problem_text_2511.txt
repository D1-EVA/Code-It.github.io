Given a distinct sequence of keys representing the preorder sequence of a binary search tree (BST), construct a BST from it.

Approach-1: 

We can easily build a BST for a given preorder sequence by recursively repeating the following steps for all keys in it:
Construct the root node of BST, which would be the first key in the preorder sequence.
Find index i of the first key in the preorder sequence, which is greater than the root node.
Recur for the left subtree with keys in the preorder sequence that appears before the i'th index (excluding the first index).
Recur for the right subtree with keys in the preorder sequence that appears after the i'th index (including the i'th index).


Approach 2


We know that each node has a key that is greater than all keys present in its left subtree, but less than the keys present in the right subtree of a BST. The idea to pass the information regarding the valid range of keys for the current root node and its children in the recursion itself.
