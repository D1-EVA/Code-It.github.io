Huffman coding (also known as Huffman Encoding) is an algorithm for doing data compression, and it forms the basic idea behind file compression. This post talks about the fixed-length and variable-length encoding, uniquely decodable codes, prefix rules, and Huffman Tree construction.

Example: 

a	0
b	11
c	100
d	011
