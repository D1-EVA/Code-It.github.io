1534. Count Good TripletsEasy426874Add to ListShareGiven an array of integers arr, and three integersa,bandc. You need to find the number of good triplets.
A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])is good if the following conditions are true:

0 <= i < j < k <arr.length
|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a
|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b
|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c

Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Return the number of good triplets.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7], a = 7, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:There are 4 good triplets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3], a = 0, b = 0, c = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet satisfies all conditions.


Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 100
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
0 <= a, b, c <= 1000
