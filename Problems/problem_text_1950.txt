Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

Height-balanced binary tree  : is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem
Example :
Input : 
          1
         / \
        2   3

Return : True or 1 

Input 2 : 
         3
        /
       2
      /
     1

Return : False or 0 
         Because for the root node, left subtree has depth 2 and right subtree has depth 0. 
         Difference = 2 > 1.
