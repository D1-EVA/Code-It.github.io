2164. Sort Even and Odd Indices IndependentlyEasy29718Add to ListShareYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:

Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.

	
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.


Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
	
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.



Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is [2,1], which is the same as the initial array. 


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
