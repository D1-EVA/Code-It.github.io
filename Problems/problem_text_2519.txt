Given a sorted array of n integers and a target value, determine if the target exists in the array in logarithmic time using the binary search algorithm. If target exists in the array, print the index of it.

Example: 


Input:

nums[] = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7

Output: Element found at index 3


Input:

nums[] = [1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
target = 2

Output: Element not found


Approach-1: 

A simple solution would be to perform a linear search on the given array. It sequentially checks each array element for the target value until a match is found or all the elements have been searched. The worst-case time complexity of this approach is O(n) as it makes at most n comparisons, where n is the size of the input. This approach doesnt take advantage of the fact that the input is sorted.How to perform better?

Approach 2

We can easily convert the above iterative version of the binary search algorithm into a recursive one. The algorithm can be implemented recursively as follows in C, Java, and Python:
