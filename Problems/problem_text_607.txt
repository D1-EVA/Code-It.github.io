1727. Largest Submatrix With RearrangementsMedium65816Add to ListShareYou are given a binary matrix matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.
Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.


Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m * n <= 105
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
