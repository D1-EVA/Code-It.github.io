Given a string A consisting only of lowercase characters, we need to check whether it is possible to make this string a palindrome after removing exactly one character from this.
If it is possible then return 1 else return 0.





Constraints: 

3 <= |A| <= 105
 A[i] is always a lowercase character.





Input Format: 

First and only argument is an string A.

Output Format: 

Return 1 if it is possible to convert A to palindrome by removing exactly one character else return 0.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = "abcba"

Input 2:
 A = "abecbea"






Example Output: 

Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 0






Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 We can remove character c to make string palindrome

Explanation 2:
 It is not possible to make this string palindrome just by removing one character
