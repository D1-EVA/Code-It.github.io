You are given a string A which is a serialized string. You have to restore the original array of strings.
The string in the output array should only have lowercase english alphabets.
Serialization: Scan each element in a string, calculate its length and append it with a string and a element separator or deliminator (the deliminator is ~). We append the length of the string so that we know the length of each element.
For example, for a string 'interviewbit', its serialized version would be 'interviewbit12~'.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 106

Input Format: 

The first argument is the string A.

Output Format: 

Return an array of strings which are deserialized.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = 'scaler6~academy7~'

Input 2:
A = 'interviewbit12~'




Example Output: 

Output 1:
['scaler', 'academy']

Output 2:
['interviewbit']




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Length of 'scaler' is 6 and academy is 7. So, the resulting string is scaler6~academy7~.
We hve to reverse the process.
Explanation 2:
Explained in the description above.
