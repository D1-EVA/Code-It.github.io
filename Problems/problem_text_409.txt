1492. The kth Factor of nMedium732209Add to ListShareYou are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

Example 1:
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 1000

Loop i from 1 to n and add i if n % i == 0. Return the kth factor if it exist in this list.
