Given two integers, x and n, where n is non-negative, efficiently compute the power function pow(x, n).

Example: 


pow(-2, 10) = 1024
pow(-3, 4) = 81
pow(5, 0) = 1
pow(-2, 3) = -8


Approach-1: 

1. Naive Iterative SolutionA simple solution to calculate pow(x, n) would multiply x exactly n times. We can do that by using a simple for loop. This is demonstrated below in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

2. Using Divide and Conquer

Approach 3

3. Optimized Divide and Conquer Solution

Approach 4

4. Using Low-Level Programming (Binary Operators)
