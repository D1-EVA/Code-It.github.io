Given A, B, C, find whether C is formed by the interleaving of A and B.
Input Format:*
The first argument of input contains a string, A.
The second argument of input contains a string, B.
The third argument of input contains a string, C.


Output Format:
Return an integer, 0 or 1:
    => 0 : False
    => 1 : True


Constraints:
1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C) <= 150


Examples:
Input 1:
    A = "aabcc"
    B = "dbbca"
    C = "aadbbcbcac"

Output 1:
    1
    
Explanation 1:
    "aa" (from A) + "dbbc" (from B) + "bc" (from A) + "a" (from B) + "c" (from A)

Input 2:
    A = "aabcc"
    B = "dbbca"
    C = "aadbbbaccc"

Output 2:
    0

Explanation 2:
    It is not possible to get C by interleaving A and B.
