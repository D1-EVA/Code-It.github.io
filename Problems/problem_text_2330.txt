Given an array of positive and negative integers, segregate them in linear time and constant space. The output should print all negative numbers, followed by all positive numbers.

Example: 


Input: [9, -3, 5, -2, -8, -6, 1, 3]
Output: [-3, -2, -8, -6, 5, 9, 1, 3]


Approach-1: 

We can solve this problem in linear time by using the partitioning logic of Quicksort. The idea is to use 0 as a pivot element and make one pass of the partition process. The resultant array will satisfy the given constraints. Following is the C++, Java, and Python program that demonstrates it:
