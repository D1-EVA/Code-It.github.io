Given a positive number N, print an N  N spiral matrix containing numbers from 1 to N  N in a counterclockwise direction and without extra space.

Example: 


Input: N = 5

Output:

2524232221
1098720
1121619
1234518
1314151617


Approach-1: 

If we are allowed to use extra space, allocate storage for an N  N matrix, and start filling out the matrix in spiral order for each element starting from N  N till 1. To maintain the spiral order, use four loops, each for the top, right, bottom, and left corner of the matrix.
Heres how we can do it with constant space:
