Given a binary M  N row-wise sorted matrix, find a row that contains the maximum number of 1's in linear time.

Example: 


Input:

[00011]
[00111]
[00000]
[01111]
[00001]

Output: The maximum 1s are present in row 4


Approach-1: 

The idea is to start from the top-right corner of the matrix and do the following:

If the current cell has value 1, continue moving left till we encounter 0, or all columns are processed;
If the current cell has value 0, continue moving down till we encounter 1, or all rows are processed.
