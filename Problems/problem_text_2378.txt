This post will discuss a few related problems that operate on the kth bit of a number.

Example: 


00010100&(n = 20)
11111011~ (1 << (3-1))
~~~~~~~~
00010000


Approach-1: 

The idea is to use bitwise <<, &, and ~ operators. Using the expression ~ (1 << (k - 1)), we get a number with all its bits set, except the k'th bit. If we do a bitwise AND of this expression with n, i.e., n & ~(1 << (k - 1)), we get a number which has all bits the same as n except the k'th bit which will be set to 0.For example, consider n = 20 and k = 3.
