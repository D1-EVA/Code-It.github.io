1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to ThresholdMedium78663Add to ListShareGiven a m x n matrix mat and an integer threshold, return the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to threshold or return 0 if there is no such square.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1
Output: 0


Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
0 <= mat[i][j] <= 104
0 <= threshold <= 105
