Given a sorted integer array and a target, determine if the target exists in the array or not using an interpolation search algorithm. If the target exists in the array, return the index of it.

Example: 


Input:

arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7

Output: Element found at index 3


Input:

arr[] = [1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
target = 2

Output: Element not found


Approach-1: 

Interpolation search is an algorithm similar to binary search for searching for a given target value in a sorted array. It parallels how humans search through a telephone book for a particular name, the target value by which the books entries are ordered.
We know that binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space, discarding one half or the other depending on the comparison result between the mid-value and the target value. The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the mid-position.
