1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to ThresholdMedium60860Add to ListShareGiven an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).

Example 2:
Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= arr.length
0 <= threshold <= 104
