Approach-1: 

The idea is to start from each cell of the first column of the matrix to print / diagonal for the matrixs upper-left half. Similarly, after the upper-left half, start from each cell of the last row to print the / diagonal for the matrixs lower-right half.Following is the C++, Java, and Python implementation of the idea:
