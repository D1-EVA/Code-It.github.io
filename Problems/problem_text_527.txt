b'1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No PointsMedium174508Add to ListShareGiven n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return\xc2\xa0the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
\xc2\xa0
Example 1:
\xe2\x80\x8b
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

\xc2\xa0
Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi\xc2\xa0<= 109
