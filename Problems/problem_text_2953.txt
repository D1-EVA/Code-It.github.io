Runlength encoding (RLE) is a simple form of lossless data compression that runs on sequences with the same value occurring many consecutive times. It encodes the sequence to store only a single value and its count.

Approach-1: 


The idea is to run a linear scan on the string, and for each distinct character, append the character and its consecutive occurrence in the output string.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python. Note that the output size will double the input size in the worst case, so the algorithm cant run in-place. e.g. ABCD > A1B1C1D1.
