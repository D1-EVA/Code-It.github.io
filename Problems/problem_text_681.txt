b"1808. Maximize Number of Nice DivisorsHard145137Add to ListShareYou are given a positive integer primeFactors. You are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions:

The number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.
The number of nice divisors of n is maximized. Note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not.

Return the number of nice divisors of n. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.

Example 1:
Input: primeFactors = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.

Example 2:
Input: primeFactors = 8
Output: 18

Constraints:

1 <= primeFactors <= 109

Then the problem is reduced to: given n, find a sequence of numbers whose sum equals n and whose product is maximized.Show Hint 2This sequence can have no numbers that are larger than 4. Proof: if it contains a number x that is larger than 4, then you can replace x with floor(x/2) and ceil(x/2), and floor(x/2) * ceil(x/2) > x. You can also replace 4s with two 2s. Hence, there will always be optimal solutions with only 2s and 3s.Show Hint 3If there are three 2s, you can replace them with two 3s to get a better product. Hence, you'll never have more than two 2s.Show Hint 4Keep adding 3s as long as n \xe2\x89\xa5 5."
