1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K RemovalsMedium89464Add to ListShareGiven an array of integersarrand an integer k.Find the least number of unique integersafter removing exactly k elements.



Example 1:
Input: arr = [5,5,4], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove the single 4, only 5 is left.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,3,1,1,3,3,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Remove 4, 2 and either one of the two 1s or three 3s. 1 and 3 will be left.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length<= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k<= arr.length
