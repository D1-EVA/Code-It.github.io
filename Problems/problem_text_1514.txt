76. Minimum Window SubstringHard10209535Add to ListShareGiven two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.


Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n<= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

This approach is also called Sliding Window Approach.


L ------------------------ R , Suppose this is the window that contains all characters of T 
                          
 L----------------- R , this is the contracted window. We found a smaller window that still contains all the characters in T

When the window is no longer valid, start expanding again using the right pointer.
