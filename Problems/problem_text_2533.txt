Given a sorted integer array, find the floor and ceiling of a given number in it. The floor and ceiling map the given number to the largest previous or the smallest following integer in the array.

Example: 


Input:

nums = [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]
Number: 0 to 10

Output:

Number 0 > ceiling is 1, floor is -1
Number 1 > ceiling is 1, floor is 1
Number 2 > ceiling is 4, floor is 1
Number 3 > ceiling is 4, floor is 1
Number 4 > ceiling is 4, floor is 4
Number 5 > ceiling is 6, floor is 4
Number 6 > ceiling is 6, floor is 6
Number 7 > ceiling is 8, floor is 6
Number 8 > ceiling is 8, floor is 8
Number 9 > ceiling is 9, floor is 9
Number 10 > ceiling is -1, floor is 9


Approach-1: 

A simple solution would be to run a linear search on the array and find the largest integer in the array less than or equal to x and the smallest integer in the array greater than or equal to x. That would be the floor and ceiling of the number x, respectively. The problem with this approach is that its worst-case time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input.
We can easily solve this problem in O(log(n)) time by modifying the binary search algorithm. The basic idea remains the same. We find the middle element and recur for the left or right subarray based on comparison result with the given number. Following is the complete algorithm:
