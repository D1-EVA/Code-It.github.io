1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a TreeMedium95588Add to ListShareGiven an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

Example 1:

Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  

Example 2:

Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1
fromi < toi
hasApple.length == n
