2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together IIMedium5657Add to ListShareA swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.
A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.
Given a binary circular array nums, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 0.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

It is the number of 1's the whole array has.Show Hint 2Call this number total. We should then check for every subarray of size total (possibly wrapped around), how many swaps are required to have the subarray be all 1s.Show Hint 3The number of swaps required is the number of 0s in the subarray.Show Hint 4To eliminate the circular property of the array, we can append the original array to itself. Then, we check each subarray of length total.Show Hint 5How do we avoid recounting the number of 0s in the subarray each time? The Sliding Window technique can help.
