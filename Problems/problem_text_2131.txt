Given an array A of size N. You need to find the sum of Maximum and Minimum element in the given array.
NOTE: You should make minimum number of comparisons.



Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format: 

First and only argument is an integer array A of size N.

Output Format: 

Return an integer denoting the sum Maximum and Minimum element in the given array.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [-2, 1, -4, 5, 3]
Input 2:
 A = [1, 3, 4, 1]




Example Output: 

Output 1:
 1
Output 2:
 5




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 Maximum Element is 5 and Minimum element is -4. (5 + (-4)) = 1. 
Explanation 2:
 Maximum Element is 4 and Minimum element is 1. (4 + 1) = 5.
