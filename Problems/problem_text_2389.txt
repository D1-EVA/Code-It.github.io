Given two 16bit positive values stored in 32bit integer variables, find the product using the 8bit multiply operator that takes two 8bit numbers and returns a 16bit value.

Example: 


 [mHigh mLow]
 [nHigh nLow]
      
 [mHigh * nLow] [mLow * nLow]
 [mHigh * nHigh] [mLow * nHigh]
                               
[mHigh * nHigh] + [mLow * nHigh + mHigh * nLow] + [mLow * nLow]
