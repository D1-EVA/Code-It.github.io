You are given an integer N. You have to find smallest multiple of N which consists of digits 0 and 1 only. Since this multiple could be large, return it in form of a string.
Note:

Returned string should not contain leading zeroes.

For example,
For N = 55, 110 is smallest multiple consisting of digits 0 and 1.
For N = 2, 10 is the answer.
