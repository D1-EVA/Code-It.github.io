Write an algorithm to generate 0 and 1 with 75% and 25% probability, respectively, using a specified function that produces either 0 or 1 each with 50% probability.

Example: 


x can be either {0, 1}
y can be either {0, 1}
(x & y) can be either {0, 0, 0, 1}


Approach-1: 

The following function generates 0 or 1 with 50% probability each, which can be used to generate 0 and 1 with 75% and 25% probability:
