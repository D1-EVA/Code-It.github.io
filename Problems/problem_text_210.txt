1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong ToMedium1025463Add to ListShareThere are n peoplethat are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with aunique IDfrom0ton - 1.
You are given an integer arraygroupSizes, where groupSizes[i]is the size of the group that personiis in. For example, ifgroupSizes[1] = 3, thenperson1must be in agroup of size3.
Returna list of groupssuch thateach personiis in a group of sizegroupSizes[i].
Each person shouldappear inexactly one group,and every person must be in a group. If there aremultiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.

Example 1:
Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
Explanation: 
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].

Example 2:
Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]


Constraints:

groupSizes.length == n
1 <= n<= 500
1 <=groupSizes[i] <= n
