You are given a array of strings A of length N.
You have to return another string array which contains all possible special strings.
A special string is defined as a string with length equal to N, 
and ith character of the string is equal to any character of the ith string in the array A.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 5
1 <= |Ai| <= 8

Input Format: 

The first argument is the string array A.

Output Format: 

Return a string array consisting of all possible special strings.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = ['ab', 'cd']

Input 2:
A = ['aa', 'bb']




Example Output: 

Output 1:
['ac', 'ad', 'bc', 'bd']

Output 2:
['ab', 'ab', 'ab', 'ab']




Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Since, the first character has to be from the 1st string 'ab' and the 2nd from 'cd'.
These are the all possible 4 combinations.
Explanation 2:
Note we can have duplicate strings, you have to add all of them.
