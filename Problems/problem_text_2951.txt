Given a string and a positive integer k, print the string in k rows in the zigzag form.

Approach-1: 


The idea is to identify a pattern in the problem. If we consider a characters index in the output, we have observed some patterns:
The first key of each row, i, is present at index i in the string.
For the first and the last row, the distance between each key is (k-1)2. For example, for k = 4, the difference is 6. So, the first element of the first row is located at index 0; the second element is located at index 6; the third element at 12, and so on Similarly, the first element of the last row is located at index 3; the second element is located at index 9, the third element at 15, and so on
For all middle rows, depending upon whether we are going up or going down, the index differs, as evident from the following code:
