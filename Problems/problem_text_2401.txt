Given a number, check if adjacent bits are set in the binary representation of it.

Example: 


00101101&(n)
01011010left shift n by 1
~~~~~~~~
00001000(n & (n << 1))


Approach-1: 

A naive solution is to consider every bit present in the number one by one and compare it with its previous bit. If the current bit is the same as the previous bit, we have found a pair whose adjacent bits are 1.
The expression n & (n << 1) or n & (n >> 1) returns true if n contains any pair whose adjacent bits are 1. For example,
