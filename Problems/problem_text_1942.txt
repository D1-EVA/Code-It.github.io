Given an inorder traversal of a cartesian tree, construct the tree.

Cartesian tree :  is a heap ordered binary tree, where the root is greater than all the elements in the subtree.


Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Example :
Input : [1 2 3]

Return :   
          3
         /
        2
       /
      1
