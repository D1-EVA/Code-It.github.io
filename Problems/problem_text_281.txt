1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 BitsEasy102345Add to ListShareYou are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the arrayin ascending order by the number of 1'sin their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.
Return the array after sorting it.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 500
0 <= arr[i] <= 104
