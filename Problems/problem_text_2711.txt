Given a linked list, reverse every adjacent group of k nodes where k is a given positive integer.

Example: 


Input List: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > null


For k = 3,
Output: 3 > 2 > 1 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 8 > 7 > null


For k = 2,
Output: 2 > 1 > 4 > 3 > 6 > 5 > 8 > 7 > null


For k = 1,
Output: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > null


For k >= 8,
Output: 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1 > null


Approach-1: 

The idea is to consider every group of k nodes and recursively reverse them one at a time. Special care has to be taken while linking reversed groups with each other.The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

Following is the C program that demonstrates it:
