2121. Intervals Between Identical ElementsMedium48621Add to ListShareYou are given a 0-indexed array of n integers arr.
The interval between two elements in arr is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. More formally, the interval between arr[i] and arr[j] is |i - j|.
Return an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].
Note: |x| is the absolute value of x.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]
Output: [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]
Explanation:
- Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4
- Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2
- Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
- Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2
- Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. |4 - 0| = 4
- Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. |5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4
- Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. |6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5

Example 2:
Input: arr = [10,5,10,10]
Output: [5,0,3,4]
Explanation:
- Index 0: Two more 10s are found at indices 2 and 3. |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5
- Index 1: There is only one 5 in the array, so its sum of intervals to identical elements is 0.
- Index 2: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 3. |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3
- Index 3: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 2. |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4


Constraints:

n == arr.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

Update this mapping as you iterate through the array.Show Hint 3Process each list of indices separately and get the sum of intervals for the elements of that value by utilizing prefix sums.Show Hint 4For each element, keep track of the sum of indices of the identical elements that have come before and that will come after respectively. Use this to calculate the sum of intervals for that element to the rest of the elements with identical values.
