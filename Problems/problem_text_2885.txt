Given an integer array, sort it using introsort sorting algorithm.

Approach-1: 

Following is the C++ implementation of the introsort algorithm is similar to the GNU Standard C++ library. It uses introsort with a maximum depth of 2.log2(n), followed by an insertion sort on partitions smaller than 16. The Quicksort algorithm is optimized by better pivot selection.
