Given an integer array, find the maximum product of its elements among all its subsets.

Example: 


Input: nums[] = { -6, 4, -5, 8, -10, 0, 8 }

Output: The maximum product of a subset is 15360

The subset with the maximum product of its elements is { -6, 4, 8, -10, 8 }



Input: nums[] = { 4, -8, 0, 8 }

Output: The maximum product of a subset is 32

The subset with the maximum product of its elements is { 4, 8 }


Approach-1: 

1. Brute-Force SolutionA naive solution is to consider every subset and find the product of their elements. Finally, return the maximum product found among all subsets. The implementation can be seen below in C++, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

2. Linear-time Solution
