Given a set S, generate all subsets of it, i.e., find the power set of set S. A power set of any set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.

Example: 



{} (also known as the empty set or the null set).
{x}
{y}
{z}
{x, y}
{x, z}
{y, z}
{x, y, z}



Approach-1: 

Approach 1: (Using Recursion)The problem is very similar to the 0/1 knapsack problem, where for each element in set S, we have two choices:

Approach 2

For a given set S, the power set can be found by generating all binary numbers between 0 and 2n-1, where n is the size of the set.
