1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued GrandparentMedium175757Add to ListShareGiven the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.
A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 0


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
