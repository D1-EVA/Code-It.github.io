1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary NumbersMedium816573Add to ListShareA decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.
Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

Example 1:
Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32

Example 2:
Input: n = "82734"
Output: 8

Example 3:
Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
Output: 9


Constraints:

1 <= n.length <= 105
n consists of only digits.
n does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.

Then you need to add up as many ones as the value of this digit.Show Hint 2If the input has multiple digits, then you can solve for each digit independently, and merge the answers to form numbers that add up to that input.Show Hint 3Thus the answer is equal to the max digit.
