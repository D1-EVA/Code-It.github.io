The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
P.......A........H.......N
..A..P....L....S....I...I....G
....Y.........I........R


And then read line by line: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"


**Example 2 : **
ABCD, 2 can be written as
A....C
...B....D


and hence the answer would be ACBD.
