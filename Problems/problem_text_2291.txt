Given an integer array, find subarrays with a given sum in it.

Example: 


Input:

nums[] = { 3, 4, -7, 1, 3, 3, 1, -4 }
target = 7

Output:

Subarrays with the given sum are

{ 3, 4 }
{ 3, 4, -7, 1, 3, 3 }
{ 1, 3, 3 }
{ 3, 3, 1 }


Approach-1: 

Please note that the problem specifically targets subarrays that are contiguous (i.e., occupy consecutive positions) and inherently maintains the order of elements.1. Brute-Force Solution

Approach 2

2. Hashing
