1871. Jump Game VIIMedium85050Add to ListShareYou are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:

i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
s[j] == '0'.

Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 
In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: false


Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
s[0] == '0'
1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length
