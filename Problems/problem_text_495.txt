1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique SubstringsMedium55724Add to ListShareGiven a strings,return the maximumnumber of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.
You can split strings into any list ofnon-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string.However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababccc"
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'ba'].

Example 3:
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 1
Explanation: It is impossible to split the string any further.


Constraints:


1 <= s.length<= 16


s containsonly lower case English letters.
