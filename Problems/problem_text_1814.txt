b'Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.\nFor example, the following two linked lists:\n\nA:          a1 \xe2\x86\x92 a2\n                   \xe2\x86\x98\n                     c1 \xe2\x86\x92 c2 \xe2\x86\x92 c3\n                   \xe2\x86\x97\nB:     b1 \xe2\x86\x92 b2 \xe2\x86\x92 b3\n\n\n\nbegin to intersect at node c1.\n\nNotes:\n\nIf the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\nThe linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\nYou may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\nYour code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.\n\n\nProblem approach completely explained :\nComplete code in the hints section.\n'
