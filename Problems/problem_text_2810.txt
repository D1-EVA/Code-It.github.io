Given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Example: 


C(i, j) = W(i, j), if there is a direct path from Ci to Cj
= INFINITY, if there is no direct path from Ci to Cj
