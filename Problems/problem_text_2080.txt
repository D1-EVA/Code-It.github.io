There is a corridor in a Jail which is N units long. Given an array A of size N. The ith index of this array is 0 if the light at ith position is faulty otherwise it is 1.
All the lights are of specific power B which if is placed at position X, it can light the corridor from [ X-B+1, X+B-1].
Initially all lights are off.
Return the minimum number of lights to be turned ON to light the whole corridor or -1 if the whole corridor cannot be lighted.













Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= B <= 10000





Input Format: 

First argument is an integer array A where A[i] is either 0 or 1.
Second argument is an integer B.





Output Format: 

Return the minimum number of lights to be turned ON to light the whole corridor or -1 if the whole corridor cannot be lighted.

Example Input: 

Input 1:

A = [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1].
B = 3
Input 2:
A = [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0].
B = 3
















Example Output: 

Output 1:
2
Output 2:
-1
















Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
In the first configuration, Turn on the lights at 2nd and 7th index. Light at 2nd index covers from [ 1, 5] and light at 7th index covers [6, 8].
Explanation 2:
In the second configuration, there is no light which can light the first corridor.
