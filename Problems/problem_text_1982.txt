Given a string A, find length of the longest repeating sub-sequence such that the two subsequence dont have same string character at same position,
i.e., any ith character in the two subsequences shouldnt have the same index in the original string.
NOTE: Sub-sequence length should be greater than or equal to 2.

Constraints: 

 1 <= |A| <= 100

Input Format: 

The first and the only argument of input contains a string A.

Output Format: 

Return an integer, 0 or 1:
    => 0 : False
    => 1 : True


Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = "abab"

Input 2:
 A = "abba"


Example Output: 

Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 0


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 "ab" is repeated.

Explanation 2:
 There is no repeating subsequence.
