1542. Find Longest Awesome SubstringHard51311Add to ListShareYou are given a string s. An awesome substring is a non-empty substring of s such that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it a palindrome.
Return the length of the maximum length awesome substring of s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "3242415"
Output: 5
Explanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.

Example 2:
Input: s = "12345678"
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: s = "213123"
Output: 6
Explanation: "213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of digits.
