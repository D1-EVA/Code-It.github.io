b'1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct CharactersEasy57819Add to ListShareA string is good if there are no repeated characters.
Given a string s\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b, return the number of good substrings of length three in s\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.
Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "xyzzaz"

The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
