You are given an integer A which represents the length of a permutation. A permutation is an array of length A where all the elements occur exactly once and in any order. For example, [3, 4, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3] are examples of valid permutations while [1, 2, 2], [2] are not.
You are also given an integer B. If all the permutation of length A are sorted lexicographically, return the Bth permutation.


Constraints: 

1 <= A <= 105 1 <= B <= min(1018, A!), where A! denotes the factorial of A.

Input Format: 

The first argument is the integer A. The second argument is the long integer B.

Output Format: 

Return an array denoting the Bth permutation of length A.

Example Input: 

Input 1:


A = 3
B = 3

Input 2:
A = 1
B = 1





Example Output: 

Output 1:


[2, 1, 3]

Output 2:
[1]





Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:


All the permutations of length 3 sorted in lexicographical order are:
[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
Therefore, the third permutation is [2, 1, 3].

Explanation 2:
There is only one possible permutation -> [1].
