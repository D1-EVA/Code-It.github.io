Given an array A of N non-negative numbers and you are also given non-negative number B.
You need to find the number of subarrays in A having sum less than B. We may assume that there is no overflow.

Constraints: 

1 <= N <= 104
1 <= A[i] <= 100
1 <= B <= 108

Input Format: 

First argument is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B.


Output Format: 

Return an integer denoting the number of subarrays in A having sum less than B.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
 A = [2, 5, 6]
 B = 10

Input 2:
 A = [1, 11, 2, 3, 15]
 B = 10


Example Output: 

Output 1:
 4

Output 2:
 4


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
 The subarrays with sum less than B are {2}, {5}, {6} and {2, 5},

Explanation 2:
 The subarrays with sum less than B are {1}, {2}, {3} and {2, 3}
