Given a binary tree, find all ancestors of a given node in it.

Example: 


The ancestor of node 9 are 7, 3 and 1
The ancestor of node 6 is 3 and 1
The ancestor of node 5 is 2 and 1
 


Approach-1: 

Recursive SolutionThe idea is to traverse the tree in a postorder fashion and search for a given node in the tree. For any node, if the given node is found in either its left subtree or its right subtree, then the current node is an ancestor of it. The algorithm can be implemented as follows in C++, Java, and Python:

Approach 2

Iterative Solution
