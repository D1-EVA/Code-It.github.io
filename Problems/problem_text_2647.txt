Given a connected and weighted undirected graph, construct a minimum spanning tree out of it using Kruskals Algorithm.

Example: 


sort all edges in graph G in order of their increasing weights;
repeat V-1 times// as MST contains V-1 edges
{
select the next edge with minimum weight from graph G;

if (no cycle is formed by adding the edge in MST, i.e., the edge connects two
different connected components in MST)
add the edge to MST;
}
