Given a string A, find the frequency of all the characters in it.

Constraints: 

1 <= |A| <= 105Ai = {Lowercase latin alphabets}

Input Format: 

Given a string A.

Output Format: 

Return an integer array of length 26.Array should contain frequency of characters in increasing order of characters.

Example Input: 

Input 1:
A = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Input 2:
A = "interviewbit"


Example Output: 

Output 1:
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}

Output 2:
{0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}


Example Explanation: 

Explanation 1:
Every charcater is present once in the string.

Explanation 2:
'b' is at indices 10.
'e' is at indices 4, 8
'i' is at indices 1, 7, 11
'n' is at indices 2
'r' is at indices 5
't' is at indices 3, 12
'v' is at indices 6
'w' is at indices 9
Rest of the characters are not present in the string
