1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right SideEasy1241166Add to ListShareGiven an array arr,replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to itsright, and replace the last element with -1.
After doing so, return the array.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
Explanation: 
- index 0 --> the greatest element to the right of index 0 is index 1 (18).
- index 1 --> the greatest element to the right of index 1 is index 4 (6).
- index 2 --> the greatest element to the right of index 2 is index 4 (6).
- index 3 --> the greatest element to the right of index 3 is index 4 (6).
- index 4 --> the greatest element to the right of index 4 is index 5 (1).
- index 5 --> there are no elements to the right of index 5, so we put -1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [400]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There are no elements to the right of index 0.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 104
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
