This post will discuss the XOR linked list, which is used to reduce memory requirements of doubly-linked lists using a bitwise XOR operator.

Example: 


link(A) = NULL ^ addr(B)// bitwise XOR of NULL with address of node B
link(B) = addr(A) ^ addr(C)// bitwise XOR between the address of node A and C
link(C) = addr(B) ^ addr(D)// bitwise XOR between the address of node B and D
link(D) = addr(C) ^ NULL// bitwise XOR of the address of node A with NULL
