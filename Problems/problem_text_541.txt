b'1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String BalancedMedium71421Add to ListShareYou are given a string s consisting only of characters \'a\' and \'b\'\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.
You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = \'b\' and s[j]= \'a\'.
Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.
\xc2\xa0
Example 1:
Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.

\xc2\xa0
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is\xc2\xa0\'a\' or \'b\'\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.
